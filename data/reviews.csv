I have a lot of good games in csgo and rainbow six siege but i find this game to be stupid because of hackers and the stupid game mechanics and geting 30fps on lowest on a gtx 1060 with i5 8400 seriously..! Even crysis(2008) and counterstrike has 1000xtimes better graphics and gameplay than this stupid game. I've heard that  black ops4 is more polished than this pile of?????????????????? better play another game or keep wasting your time dying in the game. To be honest SEAS has a lot of hackers, Thanks to ban regional matches hope atleast europeans and americans have a good game. Yeah i also accept its a good game for its price but what can bring a good game when you find a lot of hackers and can't even get your game. 90% of games on seas server are filled with hackers. and to be honest the player base has droped from 2.2m players online on steam to 800k players online.I think developers started focusing on mobile because those audience can help them I think the game is done on pc for pubg devs. Good luck if  you are trying to support a game with its bad graphics(even old games have better graphics), performance(for this bad graphics),  and hackers Hope this review helps some people buying on sale."

The developers were very lucky to stumble up on a genre and format that was immensely satisying to play. They received 100s of millions of dollars and yet their game is still produced, designed and operated worse than that of many developers with budgets in the thousands of dollars. I have no idea how a company of their size can operate with such sheer incompetence. It is embarassing and should be held up as an example of horrific game development.This is without mentioning their ridiculous and scammy monetisation system. I cannot wait until a developer with an ounce of common sense makes a realistic battle royale to challenge this and the players will rightfully be able to leave it in droves.I heartily recommend you avoid playing this terribly terribly developed game."

The game has actually gotten worse, instead of better, after ""leaving"" early access. The truth of the matter is this game is nowhere near a finished product. Endless desync issues, ridiculous bugs, and monetization apparently being priority #1 has ruined whatever semblance of a Battle Royale experience PUBG used to offer.The one saving grace for PUBG remains that it truly is the only Battle Royale game that offers realistic simulation gameplay; however if Bluehole, or PUBG Corp or whatever they call themselves these days, cannot bring the game back on track (and let's be honest with ourselves, they can't) soon, another competitor will rise up and swallow the game's player base.PUBG is destined to be remembered as a game that popularized the Battle Royale genre, but at this rate that's about the only positive thing PUBG will be known for."

Seriously?-Attempts to sue main rival, proceeds to leech successful systems like event pass for even more money-Anti-cheat system is non-existent, in my experience there is at least one aimbot/wallhack in most games-Dev team ban hundreds of thousands of hacked accounts in China, yet refuse to region lock servers when most hackers on EU have chinese or randomly generated names-On the above point, this is probably because they can milk another ??27 out of the players who've been banned from AS server for their new account-Meh, seems that ??700m+ is too little for this companyOverall I'd say it's an enjoyable experience to play and one of the better-funtioning games of its genre. Personally, I don't regret buying the game for ??27 and playing it for 250+hours since early access. However, even considering its popularity PUBG is not worth buying for that price now. This game is not going anywhere in the future and the dev team's negligence will eventually cause players taking a break from the game not to come back to it unless something changes quickly."

No. They try to fix some bugs and can be seen on patch realeses notes.The problem? They should focus more on fixing bugs and improve gameplay.Don't blaim developers. Developers just code. They don't get to prioritize bugs over new features.People complain about the game but have thousands of hours. If it was really that bad how could they played that long?

Your family and friends tell you ""she's changing for the worse, she's abusive and can't take criticism without freaking out.""You hear it but don't care. To you, she is the most beautiful thing youve ever seen, there you are, possibly hundreds of games to choose from in your library, but you choose the one that is most toxic, the one always changing but never truly fixing anthing, the one giving you an ulcer. ......But, damn, Looting is fun and Getting kills here and there feels so rewarding!.....

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,92,4,1,365,"21 July, 2018","The game is challenging yet enjoyable and leaves the player with constant room for improvement, whether it be gunplay or desicion making. Dull and simple character creation is made up for through a growing cosmetic market of gun skins and clothing. Gunplay lacks the smoothness and refinement of a Call of Duty game however, the more challenging and realistic style often results in more memorable and satifiying kills. While still enjoyable in solo play the game shines and becomes even more thrilling with a duo or squad of friends. A capable computer is a must have as the game is rather unoptimised. Major complaints would be the common occurance of stale and drawnout games on primarly Miramar, poorly placed zones particularly towards the end game and general gun and equipment balance e.g. the removal of lvl 3 helmets from the map leaving the Kar98k and M24 as unchallengeable one shotters."

(Houseguest reference) This game is a BLAST but there are bugs that have been around for the longest time that need to be addressed. I mainly play this in duo or squads with friends and we enjoy our time (most of the time) fragging together. One of the biggest things is the crazy amount of desync this game has...Holy cow...So many times I've been shot while in cover or behind walls due to desync. You just have to laugh and say screw it and move on. There are MX but its all cosmetic so there is no reason to spend money if you don't want to after you purchaseOverall - this is a very fun game when playing with friends and I would recommend it to all my friends if they want some BR action.  No cartoon BS here my guys!P.S. Just wanted to say bluehole is making improvements - This game is 10x better then when it released, So if you tried it early on - give it another shot!"

PUBG seems to have gotten too cocky with what they are doing, resulting in them neglecting this game. First off, there are so many areas where this game is broken , and they still have yet to fix them. Rather than doing this, PUBG Corp. wants to add new content into the game to try and distract everyone from the issues. The issue with this is that it is pretty difficult to enjoy new content WHEN THE GAME IS BROKEN. I have been a fan of this game for a long time, but with the recent blatant hacking and PUBG doing barely anything about it, I have been completely tunred off of this game. If its on sale for $5, sure, pick it up with friends and get a couple hours of entertainment out of it. Other than that, I dont see this game being worth it."

Large player base for a game filled with bugs, hackers, inaccurate hitboxes, and a ton of ?????????????????????t...  When I first started playing PUBG it was refreshing, filled with game play experiences never experienced before from any other games.  The concept was still new at the time even though Bluehole wasn't the first one to come up with the battle royale mode they had a pretty damn fine Interpretation of it.  Learning how to play the game was exciting!  Call me old school but I'm the type of person who sticks to one or two games and rarely tries out differnt games.  When I when won my first chicken dinner, which was about my 100 hour mark, it was exhilarating, my heart was pumping, hands shaking, and hungry for more.  Been a long time since I felt anything like that, but soon as I continued my fruitless attempts at claiming the ever so elusive dub some of the reasons why it was so damn hard to come out on top was because the game itself was never going to let you have the chance to win it in the first place.  The game is a walking, living, breathing bug, you look at it the wrong way and it'll come flying at you and kill you in the most random way possible, but me being me I didn't let it bother me too much I had faith in the Dev team to fix the issues in time...(Oh how wrong I was)  These guys do not care for their consumers as long as 51% of the player base stays content. (Chinese players)  Which brings up the next reason why I choose to not recommend this travesty of a game.  Hackers are out of control in this game and Bluehole shows no sign of stopping them any time soon.  There will be a hacker in your game atleast every two to three games, and trust me when you're in that top 10 thinking about that dub and all of a sudden you get a shot to your head out of nowhere only to find out it was a hacker, that??????????????????pisses you off.  Again, I was naive, I trusted the Dev team once more... I was patient, forgiving, and tolerent.  Not a huge baseball fan but like the rule implies three strikes you're out.  Where do I draw the line?  When Blueballs Entertainment decides to give me a bann when I'm the one who's been killed by hackers the one who plays the game fair.  Are you kidding me?  Worst part is they don't even give you a reason why they banned you.  Thanks Bluehole, I think I know why Fornite has a larger player base than you guys.  Sorry for the long rant if somebody managed to make it down this far, I was looking forward to playing some games this weekend but was pleasantly suprised by the bann message instead. Just PUBG things."

First, what I liked...- Closest thing to a battle simulator out there. The realism was what kept me coming back for more. Finally a game that doesn't pamper the player into thinking he's/she's the chosen one.- Has great potential, the maps were awesome and it's really cool exploring them.- Nice weapon selections and design. The way they behave and sound is pretty close to real life.Now the bad stuff...- The latency, oh dear god the latency! At first I was blown away by the super human reflexes and aim that everyone in the game had except me. Here I am, crouching at that perfect spot in an ambush. Player pops up and already knew I was there, even though I was silent the whole time. But after I got shot when standing behind a brick wall, I wisened up and decided to check. Turns out the best ping I get is well over 300 ms. The only time it goes down to 50ish is when connected to a server in India. All other servers (even those in Asia) are pathetic as best. For those who don't know what latency is, it's the time for a movement made on your computer to register on everyone elses. The slower this is, the slower you will seem in the game, consequently those with better latency will always have an edge.This was further substantiated by death cam replays where the player who killed me is always aiming like 10-15 feet behind me and still hitting me. I realize this could be because of my internet connection too, but the fact that other players are facing similar issues proves that it's a system problem. Bluewhatever, please fix this! It's totally ruining the experience!- Maps. Really? 50 million in sales and all you have are 3 maps?"

Turning on the mic and chatting with people both in-game and on lobby makes me happy, have got a lot of laughs and rememberable matches like that; got a lot of friends that I met in-game; and make no mistake: playing this game with friends is an absolute blast!Don't get me wrong, of course there are problems, but those will get solved in time. I have enjoyed every single minute of this game. If you are player who loves to laugh, chat with friends and have a good time, I recommend this game.

But what was supposed to be unique was their support for modding. I remember that years ago it was said that PUBG would be focused on modding, making it very easy for the comunity to write their owns mods. Which I havent even seen yet(?). Regardless, the networking funcitonality is horrible. Absolutely 0 support for SLI, you just get a buggy menu and in game graphics glitches if you try. You really have to ask yourself, what the santaclaus is the project manager is doing? Why on earth can they not fix their networking? why is it that with a new update, an old bug returns? or something else entirely gets completely... ruined?This game is not something you would see in a E-sport as it does not come down to skill.

The total game time is about 600h, not long but not too short.About the game with BlueHole:1. I have to admit that the Blue Hole is very powerful. Whether it is luck or foresight, as a commercial game company, he succeeded. From the beginning of ARMA's MOD, H1Z1 made great strides, and then PUBG's flying into the sky, Chinese Steam users from hundreds of thousands, now today's two or three million giants, as the biggest benefit of this feast The blue hole is naturally full of earning, so he said that as a business game company, he succeeded.2. However, the blue hole is extremely unsuccessful. No game company has ever had such a bad word of mouth; no game company has ever been usedless; and no game company has ever been so unaware of the tools that make money. As far as the game itself is concerned, apart from creativity, nothing is wrong, optimization is poor, and hardware requirements are too high (in this respect, it does greatly promote the upgrade of PC hardware in China and the world); what about games? The same is very bad, I can't understand a game update 8.8G, then you told me to update a few grasses, I almost laughed out; in the case of blue holes, to be honest, eating quite ugly, first get jewelry, skin, Then close the transaction, then the jewelry that can not be sold, followed by the pass ????????????a game, monthly for 100 (accelerator 30+65 pass), I am poor, can not afford.I really hope that there will be an excellent big escape game in China and the world. I am used to it, I am used to PUBG, but I hate Bluehole. Compared with Ubisoft, which is a movie, the gap is not a little bit.The blue hole is always just a nouveau riche. It is not allowed to be on the countertop. When the spotlight is aimed at him, he has the opportunity to show his style. He is exhausted and ugly.When COD and BF and ubi's big escape game come to the fore, when the big escape game is blooming, the blue hole, you have no technical advantage, no personnel advantage, let alone the company such as ""Cold Frost Aviation"" What will you do when your attitude is compared to your body?I can even foresee that you took the money that was circled and left the scene of the stage.Go well, blue hole. What we remember is the notorious you, not you as a great escapist. Why is it sad!"

They also need to use a better system I often find my bullets hitting them but not doing any damage. I also get shot through walls alot and im not sure if its the game or if its some cheaters i will go behind a wall to heal and I will get shot even though I cant be seen. Its tiring of looting for 20 min and then getting shot through a wall. They have a lot to work on and I believe the game should still be in early access. So I hope they can either reigon lock china or just take their game away entirely. I also hope they can fix or change game engines to make their game better.

It looks good, it feels good to play BUT, there are simply too many hackers getting away with freely wallhacking and auto aiming, to the point where they are comfortable enough to just make it so obvious that they are hacking that they KNOW they won't get banned. I've played this game way before they even had Miramar (We won't talk about Miramar being an absolute shambles of a map) and there was hacking back then BUT, the hackers would get banned when they did it so they kind of just slowly diminished. Until 1.0 where they update the game with a bunch of new maps and systems which is really cool BUT, they also updated their NEW ANTI-HACK SYSTEM that allows players to get away with hacking, sounds a little backwards right? Well that's how it is.I would be more than happy to recommend it to others with a thumbs up, but this issue with the hackers makes the game completely unplayable and very frustrating... I will only recommend this game to others ONLY after the developers decide to fix this hacker epidemic issue instead of going down the money grabbing route. I get that companies need to make money but, it'll be a bit hard to make money when you neglect your fans so much that they're forced to stop playing because of the people that like to ruin the fun get away with it because of and bad security/Anti-hack systems."

No. AND if they insist on doing event passes they SHOULD NOT make the free leveling rewards leave players inventory's after 30 days, people have put time into getting these, they should keep them.

I can run some high end games, but this one on medium settings crashes constantly. I read the negative reviews and I thought that it was exaggerated and I could still have fun on this game. I was wrong. I'm highly contemplating refunding this and getting it off my drive so that it won't take up any valuable space. It would be a really fun game if Blue Hole wasn't going for the money grab. They stopped caring about the game and community entirely and are just in it for the money with their loot boxes and not fixing the game breaking bugs. It's a cool idea. It's too bad that they were the first to really take off with the idea of current battle royale mechanics and now they're in last place from all of the people that are copying Blue Hole are doing it better. Save your money and go get Fortnite for free; their servers work, it doesn't crash constantly, and it's well optimized. Blue Hole has no intentions of fixing their game, so don't buy it thinking it'll get better. What you buy is what you get."

They want you to buy $2.50 keys to open crates (loot boxes). More on that they want to start charging you for custom games in the future.+ Did I say lag, constant FPS drops, game crashes, desync, more desync, oh and more desync+ Netcode absolutely sucks!!!+ They want you to spend more money of skins, loot boxes, and they want more of your $$$$$ Sadly I hate to say this but this game is not going to improve at all.

Developers constantly apologizing more and more as they continue to effortlessly lower this game into a state of despair fueling buyer's regret. The  drive to include so many microtransactions has displayed Bluehole's priorities over the much needed optimization and bug fixes this game needs. This game rode the hype train to hell. Sadly, Tencent, has made the mobile version of this game arguably better. Their free-to-play Ring of Elysium is a step in the right direction and a very note worthy alternative. Save the money and look elsewhere. Playerunknown's name and Bluehole are tainted now and will be on the same??????????????????list as many many others."

I die so much without seeing my killer only to see him run around the corner to look my body that is 5 feet away. I'm truely sad that after all this time nothing has changed. New maps yay, New weapons yay, New I don't care!!!!!! I am finally uninstalling this game and i hope to never return, I'm sure i will because i hate fortnite. But i will uninstall again. Because i have lost faith that you will ever find out how to get Desync to a reasonable level.

I used to play on Oceanic servers, and it now decides that SEA is the best option, which after playing several rounds at 200+ms, is not fun.Please return server select, I don't mind waiting longer for a game, if it means I can have ~100ms on my game. :)"

But it has gotten to the point where there are too many issues to deal with, advertisements to circumvent, and too few rewards to make me glad I spent money on this game and wish to continue playing. I do not recommend this game to anyone unless under extreme discount or free-download. PUBG is not worth the asking price. The game seeks to coerce players for additional money and repeatedly disappoints in rewarding people for playing. While still getting updates, there is not enough being done in ways of improving the game; specifically, little to nothing is being done to improve the mechanics, physics, or interaction in the world in any notable way. For example: I have witnessed server lag consistently through mutliple matches and the Death Came still does not show accurate information. Simple features witnessed in other games that has yet to be solved here.Instead of improving the game, they are adding more ways to spend money. They add events that you can partake in and purchase passes for, cosmetics locked behind passes, and changes to the menus with new banners for those same passes. It is saddening, frustrating, and does nothing to add to my enjoyment of the game. It feels as if it has become solely a money-grab at this point and I regret spending money on this game.Despite all of this, ignoring these debilitating features, I do enjoy the realism that this game offers and the thrill of playing in a battle royal. Because of that I do try to play it from time to time but I have to dig every time to find enjoyment. I cannot and do no wish to recommend this game to anyone. I feel undervalued as a player and that I am being pushed to put more money into the game. Despite getting some meager enjoyment on occasion, there is little to nothing for me recommend."

I honestly wouldn't play unless it was with friends, but since I've seen many friends be able to play solo and still enjoy themselves, I would not say friends are required to have a good experience.This game starts as a suspensful thriller, where you play cautiously to avoid losing because of the time you spent to survive and gather equipment. However, I feel this game begins to shine more when you overcome that anxiety and can play thing game with calm directed effort. From what I understand, this games support from the devs is cery poor, mostly due to the studio funding it being primarily focused on mobile, which do not have the business models that favor dedicated fans. With the declining player base, I think you'd be better off playing Fornite, a game with better support, more consistent gameplay, and  free to play."

578080,3,0,7.65612E+16,114,2,-1,871.8,"19 July, 2018","I waited for a long time before writing a review to see where the game development is heading. After the 10 month I played PUBG I can say that I cant recommend it anymore.While the game itself is quite solid it has serious flaws. First of all would be the net-code with a horrible tickrate that makes many encounters a roll of the dice. You could play with a 300ms ping and it would not make a difference due to the slow refresh time between server and client. I waited a long time to see if this would be subject to change but apperantly it is not.This brings us to the next point, the absurd idea to store hits and other information on the client-side which makes it very easy for cheaters. Both issues are most likely causes by the design idea to save some money on server-side as the client could take part of the tasks but with the result of an unacceptable tickrate.While this decision is understandable at the the beginn of development due to lacking of funds it could be changed by now as bluehole was flooded with money.Next in line would be the design ideas to add microtransactions which can be frowned upon or not but I disgust any buy-options, seasons-passes or other stuff in a game which I paid 30 bucks for.Last but not least would be the evergrowing gap between community and developer as for example it was officaly stated that all feedback within steam would not be taken into consideration for any design ideas.So all in all I conclude from my point of view that PUBG is getting milked for money while the game itself is recieving very little new content. This little content is then celebrated like a rockstar by the devs while it is basically nothing when compared to development progress of other games. I have the fear that the distribution of money to critical development areas as well as the company structure is seriously flawed which will lead the game further to ruin.Even though early access ended and the game had a offical ""launch"" it is in my opinion not out of the beta phase from the quality of the game."

I play Witcher 3 on my computer in full resolution and on very high quality and its smooth but I can't run PUBG on it without it glitching out? The makers of this game focus on making money and don't care enough on how the experience of the game itself is. Also, I get there is a learning curve to every game but I can play Rainbox Six Siege and be fine but on this game, with the bugs and everything, I can never actually have a good experience.

H1Z1 had the upside of having abugged but therefore very interesting shooting system. DaybreakGames ""fixed"" it though, and erased the old proper map. So we basically got no H1Z1. PUBG is plagued by horrid spaws for loot, only Sanhok god good spawns and better cover. But EVERY map should have had those elements implemented better so we aren't getting anywhere here.The first and second map though, how about those? The first map is in practicality better to play, but inconsistent loot spawns and cover butcher it often.And the PERFORMANCE of the game + mechanics? The framerate is a joke. H1Z1 at least enabled the community-render-distance hack into a feature of their game. By that angle, daybreak has really tried the hardest to make a good BR game and they deserve that credit. But at the same time, they got insanely overpowered grenades. And has ruined their original game. So nobody cares about H1, fair. But that game's performance is outclassed only by CS:GO here. PUBG? It is a cringy disaster, 60 fps with a mid-range GPU at 1080p in 2016-17-18 is so embarrasing i cannot see this game going anywhere long-term unless the developers realize what design-mistakes they are actively enabling with the entire map being rendered in at all times. I am not joking. That is a fact, a reality. Your GPU and primary CPU core is being hammered so hard it is unbelievable.The game mechanics are on their own sluggish to an amazing degree, but at least they aren't changed. So while bad, we can work with them. Ping? General mobility? I would love it all to be 30% faster, that would make the game perfect. But we can dream.My last word will be on the Esports side of this game. I cannot see this game going far, and i believe that my original review of this game was removed for such reasons or whoever-knows-what. But why i can't see the game going far, is basically because of the framerate. The unhealtyh addiction to RNG randomizing what guns you get. And the game-style being basically mentally challenging. In CS:GO, Melee, LoL, Dota2, even competitive WoW and the list goes on, it is easy to pick a winner. With the BR genre? Crowning the winner is the most un-fun thing i have seen in my entire life!In Melee, it is a thrill! CS:GO? It can sure be quite the ride, same with the rest of the Esport games i listed that i have dabbled into. But Pubg? Holy damn no thanks people, play this strictly as a casual game if you do not want to strain your own sanity. At this point, Realm Royale is a far more intriguing product VS any other BR game i have seen so far. That game solves cover-issues, spawns, game-fights, mechanics, and more. The only thing Realm Royale is missing is a good framerate, at least that is my take on it so far. Who knows, maybe yet another dev team will trip and fall over themselves because they do not understand what competitive natures demand? Time will tell. And time is running shorter for PUBG in my critical eyes."

Want to play a quick paced action packed game? then play on sanhok, it being a quarter of the size with increased loot spawns and the same amount of players makes the games faster and have more action. Want a slower paced game where you have plenty of time to gear up and get into the playzone (Unless you go to either Hacendia del patron, or School - 40% of the map goes there) then play on Erangel or Miramar. Plus love the great and real feeling landscape with varies quite nicley across the map. And another things thats makes games interesting is the vehicles. Imagine the blue is on your tail and you feel like all hope is lost, but then you finally get over the hill youve been climbing and theres a car just sitting there, you have a chance. plus I love motorcycles because there super fast and you can do backflips and stuff. Also another thing I love is the community - unlike some other games (Ehm fortnite) players arn't annoying and wont always instant dm you just cause they just want a kill. Ok one time I was afk at the starting of the match. When I got back on. I found myself in the ocean, when I swam to shore (btw you can swim) and I saw a little house complex which I decided to go to. But it turns out a team was already there. I just said in the voice chat ""friendly"" and they let me walk away - if that were fortnite they would without even thinkin shoot at you face the millisecond they saw you then do the ""Take the L"" dance over you, then DM you with their pickaxe. The voice chat in pubg just makes games more fun - I recommend watching on youtube a ""PUBG funniest voice chat moments"" video. And im not trying to hate on fortnite - I play it to and its good game, but I just think PUBG has all the things thats fortnite's missing.

I find this particularly obvious in the Sanhok Event Pass, which is pretty much a must for getting any sort of cosmetics. Furthermore, the insane price of the damn thing - this isn't Fortnite; I paid $50 for this game in EA and all I get is a shoddy T-Shirt?However, I must stress that the core gameplay remains untouched. It is by far the most tense and tactical battlegrounds out on the market and despite it's hacker problem and various bugs, it remains a decent overall game. Running & gunning, ghillie suits, backflips on motorcycles, advanced weapons and mechanics for - this is what PUBG does and it makes for quite an interesting playthrough. Personally, the win result is more rewarding here than other battle royales such as Epic Games' Fortnite. (I wouldn't be the best person to tell you though, since I don't get many.)"

578080,2,0,7.65612E+16,18,3,-1,997.2,"19 July, 2018","I have played this game for 740 hours since June of last year. The most recent update has made the game crash, without fail, every time I try to play it normally, with no manipulation. I can play the game but I have to use a very strange go around. Manually turning off all of the cores on my processor but 1 while the game loads. Then after it loads I must tab out and turn them back on. BONUS! If I die or win and don't tab out and switch cores off again I lose all kill credit, BP, and credit for the win (which isn't that often :( ) because the game just terminates when begins loading into the lobby.    The game is still plauged with terrible de-sync.   For example: I chute into the same building I see another guy heading to. I have my eyes on him and he sees me.  We go for the same gun but I see him about 7 or 8 yards away. I look down, spam F to pick the uzi and 1 clip up. I see the animation of my chick picking it up then go to load. As I am looking up to get him back in my sights......   This S.O.B. is loading the gun that I was positive I had reached a good 5 yards before him and kills me.    Watching the killcam to see the muzzle flash animation and hear the sound byte from my S12K shotgun abruptly cut off, on the PUBG included replay feature,  because of a single Vector headhshot while wearing a Lv2 helmet. The shot gun pellets didn't even fire. They just disappeared because of the time rift, inter-dimensional-Matrix bullet travel system. The thing that prompted me to write this review was the fact that there was a patch to download today (7/19/2018). I figured they had to have patched that stupid processors affinity crash glitch thing. NOPE~! Suck it all of the people who are having this problem that bought the game when it was in early development because of the fun and the potential of all the crazy stuff they could do with the game.   NO, no, no, no. You CAN have the patch for CONTENTS FOR IDIOTS THAT BOUGHT DIGITAL PUBG INVITATIONAL TICKETS TO GET NIFTY (lame AF) SKINS THOUGH! AIN'T THAT NEATO! And all the patches in the last 6 months or more, other than map introductions, have been just a lame money grab to pile more dollars on top of a game that needs some real issues fixed. NOT a f___king emote wheel that 1 person that logs on a day uses. Not stupid weapon skins. I just want to play this game and have it sync up as well as Fortnite (which I hate, for the record), and all the other BR games that have come out since.    Quit buying wh___s and cocaine PUBEG/ B-hole Entertainment! Get some servers that didn't come from the flea market. Use some of that cash to pay some networking pros from some old COD games or something to work on sync. Put some of those dollars to work on the infrastructure not maximize your porofit for the short term by defecating dookie skins and locked crates for your BP (earned in game currency) progress. $2.50 a key and I have like 20 just chillin!  I bought 1 when they first introduced it. Got a female exclusive shirt. Got that ""It is taking a while to deliver your items."" message.......... Never saw the shirt again. So I just gave them $2.50 for nothing. After buying the crate with in-game currency.   But...... It still scratches a gaming itch that can't be scratched by any copy cats. The game is f-d up. The programmers/ devolopers don't seem to care about real issues. They just want more ppl to drop dolars for flower shirts and such. But I always come back to the piece of crap for a few days at a time before the bugs, glitches and holes in the gameplay enrage me  enough to uninstall it."

Mostly due to it being plagued with dramatic technical issues. It still runs like garbage on anything higher than low settings, it still has desync issues, matchmaking is hit or miss, and cheaters run rampant.Meanwhile they still have the audacity to monetize the crap out of it with microtransactions. The ""Battle Point"" currency you earn is essentially worthless as most of the crates you can get with them still require keys. They even started selling a separate Battle Pass to players so they can get more loot. It really seems they have gone out of their way to nerf the crap out of any free rewards you can get.They started a ""FIX PUBG"" campaign which I thought would hopefully be a step in the right direction. Sadly I don't know that they've really been able to deliver on those promises. The fact that they even ran a ""our game is broken and we need to fix it"" campaign kinda says it all really.I would absolutely love to be wrong here and come back and give this a solid recommendation, and I will if that happens, but at this point I have little faith left that they can truly fix this game."

I rarely get upset about dying, if you play solo 98 others will experience the same thing and you just queue up for another attempt of a win.This is my first shooter game and even though some new Battle Royale games has arrived, I am too in love with PUBG to leave it :)"

Yeah the rush of an end game kill and chicken dinner is fun, and the gun battles (when they aren't bugging, glitching or full of hackers) can be pretty good, map design, graphics and sounds are all average to poor. Where it really starts to go bad is in the technical aspects. The game is an absolute mess, patches break things that were already fixed and version control appears to not exist, performance zig-zags up and down depending on dozens of unknown factors (time of day, is this a ""good"" or ""bad"" patch, are the servers trash today or somehow stable, are people lagging or desyncing all over for the first 5 minutes, the most important and dangerous part of the game until the end) even my brand new i7 8700k, GTX 1080, and 16 gb ram randomly has what appear to be framerate lag issues for no reason on a brand new fresh install of windows 10 on an SSD. Meanwhile the developers work to add the next loot box or skin, trying desperately to squeeze every last drop of blood they can before the playbase disappears due to rage/burnout from the endless issues or newer better battle royale games ecplipse and destroy PUBG.Prepare to hit invisible stuff in your car and explode, spray down enemies and never do damage, hackers to blast your head off from 400 metres away when you peaked for a less than 0.1 seconds, watch in shock and awe as your character dies seconds after rounding a corner to safety as your lag ghost gets gunned down by an enemy who could see you for extra seconds due to desync. Enjoy fun games like loot loading in after you have already run through a room giving the guy who landed seconds AFTER you a free AK47 at point blank range while you stand in amazement with a pack of bandages and a backpack as your only items, or maybe the AK DOES actually spawn but you mash ""F"" to pick it up 28 times without being able to grab it and your enemy leasurely blows you away with a hand loaded revolver he managed to pick up 8 seconds ago. Prepare to fire into the walls or roof at random when your character decides to raise his weapon or unload a mag into the windowframe because of the ""sweet"" realistic gun barrel detection. All the while new skins and packs are added by the listless developer in a desperate attempt to cash in on fanboys and kids who have free access to daddy and mommy's credit card and promises fixes which haven't come for literally years (bugs from early alpha are still in the game unfixed) Don't take my word for it though, there are streamers with 30 times the playtime I have that have endlessly documented the sad state of the game in video format.Yes the game can be fun, yes I still play (i've invested a lot of time and its a game me and my friends all can just go and chill and play) but recommend, no I can't do that, the game is a disaster and if past attempts are any indication it will probably continue to be so indefinitely. Maybe some day the devs will use the millions upon millions of dollars earned by this monstrosity to actual make an enjoyable game that will be played for years or decades and become a classic FPS like CSGO or Rainbow 6 Seige but my hopes aren't that high based on the past track record.All in all I can't recommend it at this time, with a lot of work and effort this could be a great game, maybe even one of the greatest, but its still so far from that state and I sadly must question if getting it to that place is even that high of a priority due to recent DLC like the battlepass and constant adding of new content when so much of the game is in desperate need of repair. Just fix the game already."

Back when there was no FPP, Erangel was the only map, and there were guns in the pre-game lobby. I highly, highly recommend this game, especially over the more successful competitor, Fortnite BR.People say its dying/dead, don't listen to them, its not. Sure its not the 5 million players at once monster it was back in the good old days, but I still see 700,000+ players on at once regularly. Rainbow Six: Siege has around 65,000 players (on PC) online usually, G-Mod has around 20,000. You wouldn't call them dying or dead, would you?However the game is not flawless, hackers, especially on AS servers and servers they can get a decent ping to such as OC (me) or SEA are quite common and can really ruin the game. The matchmaking needs improving too, in Australia I can never find FPP matches and it isnt uncommon to be sitting for 10+ minutes for TPP, and the event pass is a load of????????????????????? Also I'm not a fan of paying for keys for loot crates, but thats a thing you just have to live with on SteamOverall though, I really do recommend this game and I encourage you to buy it as I have always had a great time playing, whether its solo, duo, or squads."

While the idea of the game is very good, the execution of this product is complete dogshiet. Time after time, the content patches have been focused around the sale of cosmetic items, whilst the gameplay suffers. Some issues have been around since launch, others added and to the developers credit, some have even been fixed. The problem is, not enough has been done to keep my interest in this game. Literally the only thing that actually keeps me playing this game is the lack of a good alternative that isn't Fortnite. (friends prefer the asthetics of PUBG and are not interested in the building portion.) As soon as a AAA title is released from any other developer, I can pretty much guarantee myself jumping ship.

My system specs are not great and I have noticed very positive changes: i7 4th gen + GTX970. After getting more experience on the game it is now easier to know why you got killed and identifying the difference between performance issues, skill and luck. My advise for players is to stop blame-shifting, it is easier to rant and displace blame to performance issues when they die than to try to learn. Just relax and enjoy and focus to be better. Fortunately, Sanhok came to refresh the game experience and Im really looking forward to the new snow map at EOY. To make the other maps more playeable and avoid boredom I would like to see a loot rate increase. This avoids a monotonous game.Finally, there is a ton of things that the game can improve, but we got the negative comments to focus on them. I would like to see more accountability from the devs."

578080,1,0,AtomicCobra,40,1,-1,181.5,"18 July, 2018","*TL;DR at the bottomI played a lot of PUBG. Past tense. Recent descisions, such as their bootleg Battle Pass in a $30 game and the simple fact that they are even considering locking custom mathces behind a paywall. I love the tactical gameplay and the shooting mechanics of this game. The militaristic style is probably my favorite part about it, but the company behind it really isn't. As many other people are, I'm extremely dissapointed with how Bluehole has been treating the community lately. When I started playing, it was easy to see BH as a company that cared about the community, as PUBG is the intellectual child of a long time gamer, Brendan Green. But then they got a taste of success and were hooked. Record sales and player counts weren't enough, paid crates weren't enough, and even now their bootleg BP isn't even enough. If anyone is considering picking up PUBG at the moment, and that is why you are reading this review, I implore you to not. At least at the moment. For now, take your buisness with Battle Royale elsewhere. If you want to have a more casual experience, support Fortnite. Their developers are extremely receptive to the community. If a more competitive BR is more your style, try out Realms Royale. TL;DR: Bluehole is making bad descisons. Don't buy this game right now."

Yes there are A LOT of fixes that need to happen, but all things considered, it's still a good game. The loot boxes are annoying, and I wish PUBG corp would just make it so that you could just buy the crates separately from the free ones (since I now have 30+ unopened crates that I have NO intentions of purchasing keys for).

578080,7,0,eryoo,53,1,1,0.7,"18 July, 2018","First time writing reviewer here. Don't really care to write reviews much but I feel like I should in this case. I'm not going to deny the fact that the developers were wrong during the early stages of this game (game release date onward). It was clear that they weren't focused on fixing the game itself and more so focused on generating revenue through ingame purchases. However, you have to understand that BlueHole was originally a company that made cellphone games. So, ingame purchases is pretty much second nature to them. I understand people are upset about this but too much of the current and former player base are being too salty about what happened. If you weren't so salty and have been following up on patch notes- you can really tell they have changed the direction of their developers. Yeah, they made the pass a purchasable thing but you don't HAVE to buy it. Why do people complain about ingame purchases when you don't have to buy them. A lot of people are ignorant and believe that a one time purchase can fund an entire company forever is rediculous.IMO PUBG deserves more positive ratings because they shouldn't be judged on their past. :)I used to get ~100 frames with similar settings but AA and Post-Processing: on very low. But recently, I've tried setting my graphic settings higher and I still maintain high fps through the entire game.

I chose a negative review in order to so my displeasure with the progression of this game. And to put pressure on the Dev to listen to its consumers. This game is a blast to get if you just want something to play with your friends. Its High pace, exciting and can be quite comical, but, only, when the game/server let you be. I say that because the game still has a long way until it?€?s an ?€?AAA?€? game. With poorly optimized maps and servers, to FPS and Desync problems it can really break the immersion in during critical. Nothings more of a boner-killer then when you are in the middle of a firefight or an instance moment and rather than have a satisficed conclusion, win or lose, you die because of something outside of your control. Moving away from the playable aspect of the game the other issues is with PUBGs choice to implement hard paywalls for content and Season Passes, that unlock more content, is when the game is in need of bug fixes and optimization. If at anything Keys & Creates should be purchasable for in game currency rather than actual money. If people want to spend actual money so be it. But the price to unlock said Create is pretty steep if you think about it $2.50 for a single key for a random create for random rewards most of which you will get duplicates for. And guess what? You then get to ?€?recycle?€? that item for in game currency to buy ONLY a create. There is no other way to unlock said Creates. Only get the game if you got someone to play with. Otherwise stay away as it not worth it to play solo-dolo."

He convinced me after harrassing me for weeks to buy it as well so we could play together. I didnt have much faith but the thing that convinced me to buy it in the end were the promises bluehole made around those times. The game was going to have full mod support and dedicated servers. This made the game way more interesting to me. The first few weeks i played but it was barely running at all. This improved over the course of time to a certain extend. As you see ive played for almost 250 hours now before finally giving up on this game and bluehole as a company.A year later the game still runs like absolute garbage, and so do the servers. Bluehole have been ignoring community suggestions and are silent regarding any of these issues for months now. They do not admit it or try to fix it at all. Servers suffer from horrible desync and getting 60fps steady on high setting would need a $2k rig at least because of the poor coding quality.I could probably look past this to some extent when the rest of the game would be great but unfortunately its just not. The only updates we are getting are skins. Rewards for playing are points to spend on loot crates. When you can finally afford a few, you have to pay for keys to open them. Really bluehole? Those points are literally the only reward system and dont get me started on your BS season pass. Secondly there is no sign of dedicated community servers, an update or ETA, is it even on the roadmap anymore? Mod support is something I'm laughing at I ever believed in. Bluehole could not even pull that off if they tried. TLDR: Ignorant company ignoring all the issues makes for a game suffering from all the ?????????????????????t you would expect from an early access game made by a small studio.. Except they are making literal billions and development has come to a standstill. The game in its current state is an embarrasment and i'm now one of many who have quitstill 30 bucks for 250 hours isnt abysmal, only if half of the time wasnt spent rendering /s"

I gave this game lots of chances, but everytime I played the game, after one hour I closed it and wanted to uninstall it cause of bugs and bad performance. And now a few days ago I gave this game a last chance and again I just quitted, not cause of the deaths and fights, just cause of this bad performance. If u want to buy this game and take a look on the minimal requirments, dont think ""oh yea my hardware is good enough for this game"". I can tell u it isnt, Even if u are above the minimal requirments, dont think the game will run well. If u are lucky and u have enough FPS for a liquid gameplay and also can make a difference between a person and a bush, u maybe will have fun with this game, just as I had in my beginning time. But the bad perfomance is not the only thing, this game is also full of bugs, I mean the term ""E-sports ready"" is just a joke from the community to show Bluehole that this game will never never never be ready for the professional scene. So over all PUBG is a game which started very good, the game was hyped and lots of people (including me) wanted to play this game. And the first time was nice, I played it very much and had fun, also with the bugs. But with every Update the game got worse and worse. Bluehole doesnt hear what the community says and think it is a better idea to release ""PUBG Mobile"" instead of making the game better.

All they care about is how much money they can milk from it.The addition of paid crates was the first worrying thing. I've spent ??26 on this game, yet I'm expected to pay more just to be able to customise the clothes my characters wear? Why isn't this free? Yes there are some free crates but the chances of getting them are so small, its pointless even trying. Currently as it stands, I have around 20 unopenable crates, and the game wants me to pay ??2 for a single key to open one crate. Thats ??40 to open them all! Thats more than I spent on the game?? And you're not even guarated good loot? Yeah, no thanks.The Sanhok update was probably the best update this game has had in a long time. It added a new map, that showed off how good PUBG can be, but this update quickly faded out. The performance of the servers, and the optimisation of the game is appauling. I have a GTX 1080Ti, I should not be having performance problems. I should never be seeing that FPS counter go below 60. Yet, I do see it. You've probably heard all about the DeSync, so I won't reiterate this point. The developers also decided it'd be a good idea to implement a carbon copy of Fortnite's Battlepass. Its a blatant copy, yet they managed to do it terribly. The rewards that F2P users recieve are appauling, with it only being some cosmetic items that you can use for 30 days. To buy the battlepass, you have to pay more than Fortnite's costs, and you get less stuff. Also a no from me. They also like to constantly send out updates to shove the notion down your throats that they have a Invitational. Glad to know that they'll happily shove out updates promoting how you can buy tickets to see some pros play, yet rarely push out updates to fix their game. Funny that. TL;DR THE GAME AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS IS TRASH. ALL THE DEVELOPERS WANT FROM YOU IS MONEY, MONEY, MONEY AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX THEIR GAME."

On its first release it quickly became one of my favourites, each new update brought excitement and each game its own funny and engaging moments. I still adore it's build your own weapon system and the well-designed map making. However, it became clear that the devs had other plans. The introduction of loot boxes and especially a season pass kill this game which is already at a high price. The continuous lack of optimisation from day one has put PUBG behind it's competition. I loved PUBG and treasure the memories made while playing, however the refusal to optimize the game properly and a season pass making the high asking price a tough sale I can no longer see a reason to purchase PUBG."

The maker of the game fell flat on it's nose at every turn. Clearly making it obvious that it was not concerned with the game over the long haul, but instead allowed cheaters to run rampant; which in part is due to the in game clothing line that can be purchased for ingame money or real world money. So Chinese hackers where allowed to ruin the game so that the company could make money on people buying the clothing items online at places like ebay from the hackers who did not earn them. And then they allowed cheaters, who were bad enough at it to get caught and banned, to simply buy game again with a different account. It's a sham, and theft in the purest form."

578080,1,0,WeaselPig,76,4,1,568.3,"18 October, 2018","Lets be honest here, PUBG is not a perfect game. yes there are issues witrh performance (however most of those have been fixed by now and the game runs well), yes there are issues with lag. but that doesnt mean everyone should just ????????????ing bash this game. people play fortnite and its even more broken network-wise than this game. people claim Blackout is gonna be the next big br, but i beg to differ with its ?????????????????? network performance (10HZ servers with more than 60ish players alive, 20HZ otherwise) compared to PUBG's 120HZ servers. PUBG corp is trying to fix the game but there are limitations with the Unreal engine that make it hard for them to really ""fix"" the game. also to all the idiots who complain how they're just adding more maps/cosmetics to the game instead of fixing it, you do realize there are separate teams working on different apects of the game, right? the art team need stuff to do as well. they can't just sit around and do nothing. the team working on bugs is working hard to resolve issues within the game and all you people do is??????????????????on them and you wonder why the game isn't getting fixed. let them do their damn jobs and stop ????????????ing complaining. I can still strongly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a slower paced mil-sim battle royale with solid gunplay and mechanics. also, im not convinced in the whole ""desync"" issue. ive been doing osome testing of my own and what i've realised is interesting. for example, my roomate and i play frequently and whenever we're in the spawn area, we ???????????? around and play tag. when i punch him in my game, the animation happens instantaneously on his screen. however, when i walk or run towards him, the animation is delayed so i run in to him about a second before on my screen than his. that leads me to belive that its a bug with the movement animations, not desync. enough rambling... i still believe that pubg is the best battle royale experience you can get and strongly reccomend it, even though it has some flaws"

578080,1,0,dev1989,149,6,-1,69.6,"17 July, 2018","Here is how every game goes for this game:- Spawn in- Listen to a minute of cancer. That cancer can range from racism, people screaming into the mic, spamming garbage music, terrible attempts at trolling, or teams discussing their strategies out loud.- Drop in area, face three possible scenarios: - Die immediately - Get lucky enough to find great weapons/gear and murder every team - Fly far away or randomly fly to a town where nobody else goes and spend 20 minutes without seeing a soul.- If you manage to live and make it past the agonizingly painful midgame, the endgame is tense and adrenaline filled, and probably fills me with more adrenaline than any game apart from Rust.Here is why I cannot recommend this game. This still feels like a beta to me. While introducing a smaller map in the game has absolutely helped the terrible midgame, the bugginess plagues it to the point to where you can't take it seriously. It's been out for a while, it's generated a ton of revenue, and now the devs are pinching more money out of people who haven't abandoned this game for that squeaking ADHD-filled paradise known as Fortnite, but for what? Sure they've added new maps and features, but the gameplay experience is still laggy and the gunplay still feels generic and watered down. Not to mention, Mirimar is a terrible map and the devs took away the ability to exclude that map for literally no reason at all other than to most likely appease the dev team that made that crapchute of a map.In my opinion, you should wait for a AAA developer to make an actual working battle royale (hopefully BF5 adds that mode at some point) and steer clear of this one. While there can be some fun and funny moments in this game, the bugs are more headaches than they are hilarious. Perhaps when they consistently smooth out the gameplay I can reommend this game, but until then, I'll stick to playing it when I'm severely intoxicated and cave into peer pressure."

They just released cosmetic items and milked their customers and its frustrating. The optimization has gotten better with recent updates, but theres more that could be done. I hope this game is taking a turn out of the decline, but maybe they'll just release more cosmetic items. Right now you probably shouldn't spend 30 dollars on this game."
578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,52,10,-1,380.1,"17 July, 2018","This game used to be fun when it came out. After playing it for a while, I noticed many bugs, errors, glitches, and problems, but I told myself it would get better over time. After all, the game was fairly new and I wanted to give the devs plenty of time to imrpove their game. Now this is the part where game devs always seem to screw up. They notice their game is getting popular, so they start adding tons of new content. The PUBG devs added Miramar, a desert map, in order to expand the game and retain its popularity. The problem is, they never actually fixed any of the issues that the game has had since the VERY BEGINNING. Falling through the map, getting stuck in objects, wall clipping, vehicles randomly exploding, the list goes on. It honestly feels like I'm playing Goat Simulator rather than a legitimate battle royale game. And then they release it to the Xbox, and boy was THAT a disaster. The game was so glitchy that no one could even kill each other. Everyone was standing around looking at eachother but the game was so bugged that they couldn't be killed! What a joke.At this point the only thing that keeps me in the game is that it's fun to mess around with friends with... but nothing more. I can't actually expect a fair, competitive experience because of how buggy, unoptimized, and unpredictable this game is. What do the devs do? they host a PUBG invitational... ARE YOU ????????????ING KIDDING ME? This game will NEVER be ready for esports, and it is the probably the most boring game to spectate. The randomness of the blue circle is so unforgiving that even the most skilled players are doomed to die.And finally, PUBG jumped on the microtransaction train (what a surprise!). As they see their game declining in popularity, they attempt to suck every last drop out of the consumers who are still dedicated. The cosmetics in this game are completely unessesary and end up giving you a disadvantage competitively- wearing all bright yellow? Who would want to do that in a game where stealth is crucial? And yet people still buy it... because someone always will. In conclusion, it's just sad to see a game that had so much potential die because the devs were either too greedy, too lazy, or too incompetent to fix the core problems of their game. IF YOU WANT A GAME TO STAY POPULAR YOU NEED TO FIX THE MAIN ISSUES, NOT KEEP ADDING CONTENT AND MICROTRANSACTIONS. So no, I do not recommend this game at all, to anyone. I honestly do not believe the core issues will EVER be fixed."

First I'll start with the bad:Desync i.e. You KNOW you shot that guy in the face 4 times with a shotty & he just smiles & proceed to pwn you.  The replay doesn't even show you shooting him while he murders you.Cheater's & Script Kiddies: The blatant ESP / Wallhacks & or aimbots.  As a former server admin for various games I know what to look for with ESP (chameleon skins) Wallhackers & some are pretty good @ hiding it but other's are quite obvious.Greed:  The micro transactions in this game & many other in the market & slowly killing gaming imho, PUBG is not immune ($10.00 usd for a skin?) b*tch please, if you got the money to waste by all means.  PUBG by default is in it for nothing other than making the most money (who isn't) but their lack of cracking down on the cheaters / region locking servers all the while promoting invitational's & event passes, in game ads etc. etc. is just further proof that they want the last dollar they can milk from this game & you.I bought the event pass & let me say that it is a waste of time & money for a few skins that you get to keep while other actually expire(W...T...F), fool me once & that's all you get, not getting any more money off of me.The good about the game:  Fast paced, semi good graphics, solo play is o.k. but it's probably better with friends or a group.  Game mechanics for the most part feel balanced BUT work needs to be done with hitbox accuracy & damage corresponding with where shots hit.  Honestly it feels just like any other FPS a la COD or Counterstrike to me but with 3rd person view thrown in.I'll continue to play the game but I can't honestly say I'd recommend anyone run right out & blow 30 bucks on the game, just get in on sale or something.Until they region lock, fix the blatant cheating & get the desync server issues fixed it's just not worth the money."

Once server maintenance is complete, we have to release another update because the new updated screwed something up. Lets not forget that we like to ban players for no reason and then offer no explanation on why we banned them so be prepared to buy the game twice (because we're really only after your money). We have a wonderful loot system! Once you play about 50 games and get a decent amount of BP you get a crate! But youll have to spend money to buy keys to open it!

We're more concerned about advertising out new outfits than useful information in the lobby. Its really hard for us to come up with new and changing things so we just come up with stupid new outfits, because, after all, WE JUST WANT YOUR MONEY.

The group I play with has literally encountered cheaters with a flying bus before. Honestly, it's the only game I spend time playing with my friends/family at the moment though, which is why I continue to play it. The cheating has gotten so bad that even if you're the most cautious of players you'll regularly have someone shoot you through a wall or find you when you're completely hidden. There are many times where I'm in the lobby of the North American server and I hear repeated recorded messages in Chinese. Run it through Google Translate and you'll get the gist of it - they are advertisements for ways to cheat at the game. There's also issues with Chinese players coming to play on the NA server. Many of them are just fine and play the game normally, but the game has issues with ping times. Add a high ping with a game that relies on the client's response for the outcome of a scenario and you've got players skipping around. You could aim perfectly from your point of view and still miss them because of this.If you have friends that you want to play the game with, sure, go for it. It can be fun to screw around. The physics of vehicles in the game are especially weird.If you're going to play by yourself or try to take it seriously, I can't recommend playing it. Looking back, if I knew what this game would become after playing it for a while, I would not have purchased it in the first place."

I find the new sound-updates very confusing and can't pinpoint the exact location of the shots like in the early days. In addition the redzone is so loud everytime i'm in the redzone i mute the sound of the game, because it hurts so much in my ears.

Biggest issue is that the developer trying to squeeze every penny out of their player base. Selling the game for a premium price, new loot boxes every month, season pass (with timed rewards) and now they are talking about having a price for custom games. It's hard to not be cynical about this game and I would only recommend the game if you read literally nothing about it and only play it like a few times a month, unfortunately there's no real competitor at the time of writing that is doing the authentic style battle royale."

You need to go to new Zone very quickly when there sat down the enemy. Between the points are fields, bald as a knee, and there the enemy is in cover with optics, who knows where you'll run from. If you're not lucky enough to be at the new Zone every time, you're just a free frag for those in the zone. Extremely unbalanced. To fight the enemy at a distance you just don't have time. Even if you try, you will give out your location and then you do not have a chance to reach the Zone too.I think the Zone as provocation of fights, bad idea. It was possible to make a banal capture point, which requires holding time, in a random place on map, so that everyone ran there.2. When receiving damage, there is no hint which side you are being fired. Even if you can hear which side of the fire, it is impossible to navigate under fire. This is illogical, because in reality receiving damage you will physically feel, with what hand had landed bullet.So most of the deaths in this game are you running across the f**king field to zone, you're getting shots from nowhere, and you're dying.3. There is no possibility to move quietly, at all. Even sitting down you trample so that you will be heard if the enemy passes near the house outside. When you try to track down the enemy, to outwit, it turns into a banal counter-strike, who better honed nerd reflexes, but not the idea to win."

Able to kill you instantly somehow, able to glitch through walls, aimbots, and so much more. I'm Australian, and there's a fair load of Chinese cheaters hanging around, so I go onto a North American server, and about 2/3 of the people there are Chinese and do not speak english at all. What I'm asking for, is; please region lock China, just to Asia. Please. Please. Please. Please. I'm begging you. PUBG is dying because of Fortnite and we're on a last stand. With Chinese Hackers comes bad reviews. with bad reviews are poor ratings. With poor ratings, comes poor popularity. With poor popularity comes... Fortnite overtaking. Also, by the way...THE ONLY REASON WHY FORTNITE IS POPULAR IS BECAUSE IT IS FREE AND CELEBRITIES PLAY IT, THEREFORE ALL OF THE COOL KIDS WHO FOLLOW THE CELEBRITIES FOLLOW IT AND THEN OTHER KIDS PLAY IT. NOT BECAUSE IT HAS A BATTLE PASS AND IN-APP-PURCHASES. The only reason why I am giving this game a positive review is because I don't want Fortnite to overtake. Cheers for reading."

They have been so focused on adding new content that they have not fixed some of the unrealistic and quite honestly immersion-breaking animations, sounds, and items. Not to mention that audio does not seem to be working properly at random points. In multiple instances, I watched players land and run by me without a sound. This also led to numerous deaths and losses and made me not want to play. Additionally, the devs try so hard to communicate with the playerbase, but fail to add things that players need and want until long after it is called for.

Servers has lag, meaning that actions and controls are clunky. It is still playable, but it can be noticable sometimes. For example, getting into cars, opening doors, and picking up items. To some people it is unnoticable, but I can assure you it is there. About 6 months ago or so, they updated the game. When they updated the game, when the desert map came out, I notice the response lag when shooting enemies from afar (bullets were slower in a sense where the usual place to shoot was changed. Making it more difficult to shoot at enemies because it became unpredictable). I'm not sure if was part of the update. PUBG has sold over 30 million copies of the game on both console and pc. I am not sure why they don't optimise the game even though we know they have the money to do so. Now, I prefer PUBG over Fortnite. But I must say that Fortnite is a better game/choice for someone to play. It took them awhile to add the new map. If I can remmeber, they announced it or rumours about it came before Christmas of 2017. It took them 6 months to release it (granted they banned a lot of cheaters, but the process was so slow. And there shouldn't have been that many cheaters at the first place). And they didn't add much to the game between that. I have an average pc (R5 1600@3.8, GTX 1070ti, 16gb ram) and I still game in-game frame stutter every once awhile. Now they added the event/season pass just like what Fortnite has, but they did it poorer than them. I used to play it a lot. I took a break from it because I got bored of it. I decided to play again because of the new map. But I don't find myself liking it too much. The problems that plagued the game are still here. I am not a fan of the microtransactions of the game. The lootboxes are rigged. Very low chances to get anything. I got 5 red t-shirts in a row. And it also takes forever to purchase a lootbox because you have to grind a lot. You don't really get anything out of the game. It was fun playing with friends, but even playing this game with friends gets boring after a while. When you buy a crate. which is a grind, you may get different crates,but just one. And these different crates may or may not require you to buy a key. So you would have to grind and buy a key if you wanted to open the crate. And if you want more of these crates in-game, then that will cost you extra. More grinding for a poor lootbox system with not that impressive cosmecticsTL:DR-Poorly optimised given PUBG Corp. has money and resources (look at Xbox)-Poor framerate/graphics-Not Free compared to it's competitor-Terrible lootbox system/below average cosmectics-Slow at releasing new content-Fun for a bit then gets boring (even with friends)-Anti-cheating software that should have been there early after the games release-Unimpressive event/season pass"

Do I feel like they've made as much progress as they should have, considering how much money they've made? Absolutely not.Putting loot boxes that require the purchase of keys to open is slimy, especially when the game is in sore need of refinement to its core systems and mechanics. Then putting in an ""Event Pass"" was double slimy, considering the state of the game and the desperation of the community for a real progression system. So they gave us a progression system, and told us to pay $10 per month for it. No thanks.They've released two new maps. One of which, Miramar, is terrible and amplifies the problems of the game's core gameplay loop, like the uneventful mid-game, the reliance on RNG loot/vehicle placement and emphasis on running from circle to circle.The shooting mechanics still feel clunky and unreliable. Some of this is by design, as they tried to make the guns feel ""realistic"", but it just feels frustrating when you haven't had the experience to master the weapon mechanics and you're not sure why your shots aren't landing.Cheaters still run rampant.FPS still spikes. Early game lag is still very real.PUBG simply didn't live up to its potential.

Some matches are strictly unplayable.My only regret is that I cannot refund this game.- EDIT - Upon reading the description, I wanted to offer some more thought:""PLAYERUNKNOWN, aka Brendan Greene, is a pioneer of the battle royale genre""  - Brendan Greene might have popularized the genre, he certainly didn't pioneer it. In fact, I would argue that Hunger Games servers on Minecraft are more befitting of allocade of pioneering the genre.""creator of the battle royale game modes in the ARMA series and H1Z1: King of the Kill."" - While he did create the battle royale game mode in both ARMA II and ARMA III, his role in H1Z1 was that of a consultant, being primarily developed by Daybreak Game Studios.""Greene is working with a veteran team of developers to make PUBG into the world's premiere battle royale experience."" - The game has always had its flaws. While it was in early access, they were more forgiveable. However, the game is fully out of early access, and these glaring issues still exist. Most of the development in the game has gone towards a more visually appealing game, more maps, and loot boxes. These are fine goals, but they shouldn't take precedence over the quality of the game. - While the game does control slightly better than Radical Heights, you will find that upon trying to pull the trigger of your gun, your avatar will succumb to a wild fit of Parkinson's. If the goal of this game was to be the ""premiere batte royale experience,"" they -- much like most of the weapons in this game -- have wildly missed their mark.In conclusion; take the money you would've given to Mr. Greene, and buy yourself as many stocks in Blockbuster as possible. They will carry value longer than PUBG."

First some PROS:+ Still might have some potential...+ Highly competitive -> no storytelling, just get in the action (for those who want this kind of games).+ Thrilling -> reaching the finale is a quite an adrenaline boost, you have to focus in, stay sharp and vigilent.+ Quite difficult -> weapon mechanics for example: bullet drop, recoil, weapon attachments, bullet travel speed, damage etc. have to be considered and make the game harder to master thus more interesting and rewarding.Now let's get to the points which make all the PROS above irrelevant. The developers managed to turn this game into absolute garbage: - Doesn't matter what kind of PC you have: Crashes, Stutters, FPS Drops 24/7- Doesn't matter how fast your internet is: Their servers don't give a damn- Doesn't matter how good of a player you are: You die to game bugs, lags, freezes, crashes, desync ent.- Doesn't matter if developers see these comments: You get crates with fancy clothes to dress your character and patches that continue to ruin the gameplay and performance.- Doesn't matter that new maps are released: All of them are unplayable due to the horrible server performance/netcode- Doesn't matter if you actually want to play: ""Servers are too busy. Please try again later.""A few examples:* You land with a large group o people around that try to defeat you, you find a weapon, you can not pick up the weapon because the game lags out HARD (no matter the internet connection), you die to someone who had ""server luck"" on their side and actually picked up a weapon.* You try to remain stealthy and silent so people don't spot you, you die because someone followed you by seeing your bugged out weapon models randomly hanging in the air on the path you took before.* You get shot at, you see who it is and hide behind a big???????????????rock. You are perfectly hidden, the guy doesn't see you and shoots at the air near the rock, you die because these shots hit you. (Confirmed with death-cam)* You run into a guy, blast a shotgun right into his chest/face at close range, (blood shows confirming you hit him) but somehow he's perfectly fine, shoots you and kills you, you check the death cam - his HP remained full all the time.All examples above do not occur rarely, but daily and theres much more.

For months we asked for features like map selection so to avoid the terrible 2nd Map, MIramar. After months, the feature was added, and then Bluehole made some more crates. With the release of a 3rd Map, Sanhok, which nobody wanted as the game still suffers from bugs and cheating, Bluehole, after only a few months of its existance removed map selection, undoing their only positive decision since 1.0. This game could've been the leading BR, but Epic actually adds features and fixes bugs. The game is fun, but don't expect a positive experience."

Yes it's compeditors have to started to grow out of it's league, but in reality PUBG is a sublime work of art that works at it's own pace. If im going to review this game, then I might as well bring up it's main rival ""Fortnite"", a  game almost the same in playstyle. Fortnite offers reliable multiplayer compatibility, high quality voice chat, and an addicting playstyle. To the media, Fortnite completly incinerates  PUBG by popularity standard, but if you think about it; PUBG isn't mean't to be played like Fortnite. Unlike Fortnite, PUBG requires it's players to have an enormous amount of FPP/TPP combat skill. You could go for weeks in PUBG, to not even get intoi the top 3. Fortnite's play style is more, ""by-the-book"". If you have good aim, a twitchy finger, good hotkeys, a knack for quick non-strategical looting, and a full squad of people that can do the same; you're golden. However, In pubg, looting is one of the most difficult parts of the game. For starters, you can only have two primary weapons, one pistol (or sawed-off), and an unlimited about of grenades that have to have assigned hotkey, if you don't want to drag them into you grenade slot via inventory. Oh... and one melee weapon for the trolls. Along with this hard to use (versus its compeditor) loadout, you have gun modifications. Suppressors, Flash Hiders, Extended Magazines, Quick Draw Magizines, a combination of Quick Draw and Extended Magazines, Angled Grip, Vertical Grip, Thumb Grip, Holographic Sigh, Red Dot Sight, 2x Scope, 3x Scope, 4x Scope, 6x Scope, 8x Scope, 10x Scope, 15x Scope, Backgrip, Cheekpad, Bullet Loops, Shotgun Schokes, you name it! Rather than finding upgrades of each particular gun (as it is in fortnite), You have to work your way up with gun modifications, and even then, they only give you slight advantages. Everything else is based on what gun you can have, and your shoot-and-cover technique. Something [SUBSTANTIALLY] important to note is that you can build and PUBG. You also can break stationary objects, other than windows. This makes Fortnite less about skill and more about how fast you can click your hotkeys. PUBG is all about cover, if you don't have it, you might as well be a sitting duck. PUBG: 86/100Fortnite (in its league): 89/100"

This helps me understand the mechanics, the community, the good and the bad. I've been gaming since 1993, gaming on the PC since 2002, and I competed in tournaments sponsored by EA in 2008 and 2009.I was relcutant to buy PUBG when it first came out, and it took a lot of friends to force my arm into getting it. When I got it, PUBG was one of the most popular mainstream games. I didn't want to get it because I heard horror stories about people getting banned because they killed a ""popular streamer"" and that said ""popular streamer"" accused them of stream sniping or hacking. When developers put so much capital into particular players of the game, the outcome isn't usually positive.Initially, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hackers weren't so bad, and I didn't get banned for killing a baby streamer. I was impressed at the graphics and feel of the game, although the hit registration seemed to lack. (I have over 120/120 internet, so my internet was not the issue)Back in 2017, I quit PUBG when a massive wave of asian hackers swept over the game. At least 7/10 of our games ended with someone aimbotting with a bunch of random letters and numbers in their name.I returned in early July 2017, and although I remembered some of the reasons why I liked this game originally, I also remember some of the reasons why I left. The problem with hackers still exists, although it is noticably less (so is the active population of the game though).At this time, I cannot recommend this game. Perhaps it is fun and playable in a LAN or Tournament environment, but for the common gamer, with the hit registration problems and the remaining hackers who go unchecked, the game has not reached it's potential. If they can clean up the registration, possibly by restricting NA players to NA servers, AS players to AS servers, unless they are grouped together, the game will be much more enjoyable.If the game improves and I am still playing, I'll revise my review. At this point, the game is more frustrating than enjoyable.07/18/18 Update:After the latest patch, I spent over 15 minutes refreshing the game.

It is action packed, however hard to master. I first played PUBG on my Xbox a few years ago (Sure, it does kinda suck on xbox) and It was interesting. It has a steep learning curve but it's Even more fun when you learn what you are doing then it is when you are a noob. The Devs don't listen much, but with their new ""Fix PUBG"" Program they are running it is getting much better. It has 3 maps (2 being 8x8 Kilometers, as i said earlier) and one being  4x4 kilometers. Even if you hear all of the negative reviews, you should try it out! It is actually a fairly good game. Sure, the gameplay loop can get boring if you keep on dying the second you spawn in, but most of the time you don't.8.5 / 10"

This helps me understand the mechanics, the community, the good and the bad. I've been gaming since 1993, gaming on the PC since 2002, and I competed in tournaments sponsored by EA in 2008 and 2009.I was relcutant to buy PUBG when it first came out, and it took a lot of friends to force my arm into getting it. When I got it, PUBG was one of the most popular mainstream games. I didn't want to get it because I heard horror stories about people getting banned because they killed a ""popular streamer"" and that said ""popular streamer"" accused them of stream sniping or hacking. When developers put so much capital into particular players of the game, the outcome isn't usually positive.Initially, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hackers weren't so bad, and I didn't get banned for killing a baby streamer. I was impressed at the graphics and feel of the game, although the hit registration seemed to lack. (I have over 120/120 internet, so my internet was not the issue)Back in 2017, I quit PUBG when a massive wave of asian hackers swept over the game. At least 7/10 of our games ended with someone aimbotting with a bunch of random letters and numbers in their name.I returned in early July 2017, and although I remembered some of the reasons why I liked this game originally, I also remember some of the reasons why I left. The problem with hackers still exists, although it is noticably less (so is the active population of the game though).At this time, I cannot recommend this game. Perhaps it is fun and playable in a LAN or Tournament environment, but for the common gamer, with the hit registration problems and the remaining hackers who go unchecked, the game has not reached it's potential. If they can clean up the registration, possibly by restricting NA players to NA servers, AS players to AS servers, unless they are grouped together, the game will be much more enjoyable.If the game improves and I am still playing, I'll revise my review. At this point, the game is more frustrating than enjoyable.07/18/18 Update:After the latest patch, I spent over 15 minutes refreshing the game. I could not even access the lobby, all I received was ""Servers are too busy, please try again later.""My wallet is too busy next time you have an event, please try again later."

This game is as unoptimized as a game could be. The new map, Sanhok, is unplayable with several complaints of even VERY high end machines not being able to run it smoothly.

PUBG just keeps piling more and more bugs that must be fixed and by that time through observation of playing this game I have only seen fps improvements and some ways to alter lagg.

I would be fine with merely sucking at the game, but it seems like the vast majority of my deaths now are at the hands of people who don't even have their crosshairs on me (and aren't leading me), can shoot full auto with no recoil, are able to see me through walls, or their aim snaps directly to me the instant they aim down the scope.  It's practically impossible to win when the competition can endlessly cheat their way to victory.Despite endless complaints from the playerbase, as many of the other reviews are pointing out, it seems the devs have no real desire to address this issue.

CHASE YOU AROUND THE MAP AT THE START TRYING TO PUNCH YOU OUT AND YOU LITERALLY CAN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK ANYTHING UP WITHOUT HAVING TO DRAG AND DROP. See how it's all connected? Instead of fixing the autistic controls and all that jazz, they're adding in more cruddy maps and updating the menu that literally plays a new song every time I play the game. Not to mention the cases, who thought it'd be a good idea to release lootboxes into a game where you can barely even tell whether you're fighting a man or a woman, as you can rarely see who's shooting at you? And if you do manage to spot them, you probably won't even be able to make out more than a few details because your settings are turned down to very low, otherwise you'll suffer immense frame rate drops and lag because you need a beast PC to run this poorly optimized game. I see a lot of people complaining about hackers, but really I've never run into one. The game is legit just GARBAGE and if I'm honest I don't think it'll ever be good. For all you kids who are about to go into the comments and say about how it's supposed to be realistic, this game is far from it. Hell, I think I'd rather 1v1 someone in real life than in this game, I'd probably have a better chance of being able to spot them, shoot at them, and run away if need be without accidentally jumping past my cover or some crap. This game is just AWFUL, and it's not a surprise that way less people are playing it now. It's just so goddamn boring and autistic. Sad part is, they could have fixed it all SOOOOO easily when it first came out. But they just kept rushing to fix the minor bugs and focused too much on advertising the game so they could make more money, rather than actually making it fun and easy to play without camping on the edge of zone with a Kar98k and an 8x scope. I'd rather play Minecraft hunger games than this waste of money. I'd rather play FORTNITE than this game, and I hate that game too.

The desync issues, random crashes, laggy hit reg just make me hate this game even though I love the gameplay and the concept. As of right now I can't really understand how they can claim this game is tournament ready, or competitive mode ready at all... I literally chuckle every time i see the PUBG Invitational background. It just seems so ridiculous. I could care less about new maps and skins and vehicles as long as the CORE gameplay is really refined and well tuned. Fixing the desync, lag, and random crashes (crashes that i only have experienced after the last update) would make a world of difference. Maybe the devs just made too much money too fast... I can only hope that eventually I can redact my verdict on this game but for now, not recommended at all. Good concept good feel, poor optimization. It's really killing this game for me."

Around the time when they added the new desert map was when it was clear that this game was starting to decline. It has always been riddled with bugs and glitches, and even after its official 1.0 release, it still feels and acts like it is a broken game. The desert map was too big and not as fun to play on as the original map.There is a lot of luck involved with winning in this game. If you don't find a gun within the first few seconds, you're pretty  ????????????ed. If you don't find a good vest and helmet and find a lot of meds to keep your health up in combat, you're pretty much ????????????ed. There is really no point in shooting at someone who is far away and near decent cover because as long as they have more meds than you, they can keep ducking to safety, heal, and return fire. If they have more meds than you, that in a way forces you to have to push on their location, which could give them an easy kill.This game has 0 progression and there is nothing to unlock and try to earn. No ranking system. It has recently added an Event Pass similar to the Battle Pass in Fortnite. The Event Pass should not have been behind a paywall. This game was $30 and you have to pay real money to open loot boxes (buying keys) and access and a real progression system (Event Pass). Fortnite's Battle Pass is a much greater value because it costs only $10 and the game itself is FREE. All the money you'd have to spend to enjoy PUBG at its fullest and it's still very buggy and very unbalanced.If you want to get aggravated over playing Battle Royale (because lets be honest, dying in BR is frustrating) just play Fortnite. You'll have a much better time. Cross-Platform and frequent updates and much more fluent gameplay make it the better option."

The game had so much potential, however once the devs added vaulting, it feels like every other attempt at improving the game has gone downhill. Not to mention they are trying to copy fortnite with a ""event pass"" that offers half of what fortnite offers. This game has turned into a money making machine off people who are unsuspecting of these scams. I would NEVER reccomend this game to anyone as it is currently in its worse state.

578080,2,0,CheddarATS,146,1,-1,88.1,"15 July, 2018","PUBG has been an interesting game to follow. It skyrocketed to #1 on Steam across the span of a year while still in beta, but has still garnered very negative coverage from many unhappy buyers. What is the problem with PUBG. Well, the gameplay has very little to do with it. I can say that everything client side is well made, except maybe the graphics and optimization, which is very dissapointing for a game made in Unreal 4, a very capable engine that pushed out very mediocore graphics for this age. I honestly think the gameplay is a bit lacking, as if you get some good loot you can just sit in a building for 20 minutes then shoot the last guy who had no chance of knowing where you were, and then win. The game just isn't very satisfying, and shooter games that test knowladge more than reflexes have always been a problem for me, at least multiplayer ones. But, I can see that some people do like that kind of gameplay. No, I can tell you that this game fails on levels that transcend gameplay. They all come down the incompetence of the deveolopers, Bluehole, and more specifically PUBG Corp, an extension of Bluehole. This developer can be blamed for all of the shortcomings and downright awful things the game does. They have caused major problems concerning the game's netcode, which is a major issue for an online game that is based on getting a few hits on an opponent. Throughout the game's lifespan, players have been on both the giving and recieving end of getting kills/killed with no line of sight on the opponent. I also recall someone in my game who sprayed an entire M4 clip at me at point blank range, and missed all his shots, and I quickly sprayed him down in a matter of seconds, followed by him just saying ""What the ????????????"" in proximity chat. I can tell you I didn't deserve that kill.This leads onto the other issue of a massive hacker epidemic. Many people who play on Asian servers have reported a massive group of hackers in every game, with esp, no recoil, and ?????????????????????. There are also cheats that exploit the faulty server connections, and causing cars to fly. In fact, the game has such a hacker problem that a top player and streamer, Shroud, was banned for riding in a car with a hacker, but the hacker himself hasn't been banned.I'd like to go down the history of ?????????????????? things Bluehole has done to it's customers.#1. While claiming the game would have no microtransactions or cases before exiting beta, they added a few crates to the game, at least one requiring a key to open, costing the usual key price of $2.50. Remember this game is $30! #2. A few chinese players in Steam reviews have claimed ads for game accelerators for sale by Bluehole themselves on the main menu, due to the abismal preformance of the Asian servers at the time. In fact Asian server preformance is so bad that many chinese players still decide to play on Western servers, at least in part due to both hackers and preformance.Others say that hacks were advertised, but these claims haven't been proven to be true.#3. This game is a very popular streamer game, and for a while, streamers were extremely celebrated by the devs, going so far as to ban many players outright, full permanent bans, for ""stream sniping,"" because the streamers had suspicions of them. Needless to say, many players were falsely banned because of angry streamers. One person, by the name of StoneMountain, was particularly notorious for this, being an early content creator and supporter of the game, going so far as to request a ban on someone for honking their car horn while they were passing by. And the devs just went along with it! This has since passed, but this shows how much Bluehole actually cares about the average consumer. Just a person who has money that they can squeze out of them.#4. Bluehole have recently tried to sue Epic Games for Fortnite daring to use the same genre as them. Oh No! They have recently pulled out, realizing that they will obviously fail the case, and when they do, they would have their Unreal liscense revoked, because Epic Games own Unreal 4! How could they be this stupid?Now, I'll admit, #2 and #3 are both old issues, and have since been fixed. But surely, optimizations, on both server and client side, have been adressed by the devs by this point. I mean, the game's been out for over a year now, many of these issues must be fixed, right? Nope! So what have PUBG Corp been working on? Cases. So. Many. Cases. Most updates have shipped with cases, most of which have insanely low droprates for anything that looks better than a grey shirt. Droprates can go as low as .01%! Compared to CSGO and knives, which the community doesn't actually know, but they can estimate from statistical data that it's around a .44% chance. This artificial rarity can only help to make Bluehole look like greedy ?????????????????????s who just want your money. What's the most substansial change besides that? ARs had marginal damage changes? Yeah, like that's going to help the game. Most recently, there has been the Event Pass, a blatant ripoff of the Battle Pass from Fortnite, except a much worse value, tied to a much worse game. They even had to patch it to make it a value that DEDICATED FANS would actually buy, as you wouldn't keep the rewards after the even ended, which immediately makes the pass worthless after the event is over.Knowing all this, will you buy this game? I would hope not. If you're one of the 5 people out there who don't own this game yet and are thinking of buying it, don't. Vote with your wallet to not allow lazy game devs to sell millions and millions of copies. I wholely regret ever buying this game and ever spending 60 hours on it. I don't even understand how I could stand it... I really believe that the Battle Royale genre can be an amazing experience. In fact, many early reviews of this game have praised the game for it's tense combat situations and immense satisfaction of winning a game. But I do not think this is the best this genre has to offer. People critisize Fortnite for being a Battle Royale game for babies, but I'll still prefer a game for babies over trash covered in bugs, poor netcode, and loot boxes. I find it funny that Steam's best seller has mostly negative recent reviews. Maybe when it has positive reviews again, I'll try it. But until then, I'll stick with a compitently made game.If I've missed anything, please let me know. I want this review to be a comprehensive guide to the ????????????ery Bluehole has been pulling."

It shouldn't be that hard you just hit tab or some other button and you are sent to it only a small portion of the map should have to be loaded in and you can pick up every weapon in the game, with every scope or just have a menu to select it.

Overall, I've had a positive experience with it but for a few caveats. First, and least important; it can be a steep learning curve! And that's okay! At first it was fun just to try to survive as long as I could, collecting things, avoiding people, learning how to pick things up, use attachments, drive vehicles, etc. Secondly, and I know this is a point that is debated amongst people, the gun shots are too loud. Yes, I know guns are loud in real life and that this game is striving for realism. Still, unless they change the level of volume on shots fired, offer a slider, OR (I feel this is perhaps the best solution), reduce the sound of running/walking drastically but for a very small radius, then I'm going to keep using an equalizer to spare my ears. If I don't want firing guns to make me go deaf IRL, I certainly don't want them to in a game. Thirdly, and this is my biggest point of contention: Loot boxes. Truly, I'm okay with them to a certain extent if they don't change gameplay up in any significant way. Cosmetics are A-okay in my book. I think it's crap that the boxes you can earn as someone who's already payed once for the game but not again for ""keys"" or the pass can be locked behing a paywall. Either I've earned the darn crate and deserve my sexy/studly shirt or I haven't. It's frustrating to earn enough points to get a crate, excited to see what you may find, only to discover you need to pay to open it. Give players the option to choose if they want a crate that needs a key or not, or ditch the keys entirely. Either way will insure my good will.Still, overall I've enjoyed my time with it and would recommend it if you can live with those three things above. It is fun overall."

Between the lag and the glitches, this game is impossible to play.  The game frequently hiccups during firefights, especially close range.

Try picking up a gun when you land before someone else does and you press the action button 4 times and it doesn't do anything.  Then you get shot by the guy that landed next to you and got his gun first.Aiming is impossible, and since you only get a chance to shoot maybe once each game, you can only practice once every 10 minutes.  This means you have to play hours and hours before you develop any basic proficiency at the game.

However, PUBG Corp is the most incompetent game developer when it comes to optimizing the game, but most importantly server ping and/or tick rate. It's OK if a game might lag due to high graphical detail, which PUBG does not have. Lets be honest, the games looks like a tuned up version of Battlefield 2, which was released in 2005. Also I may turn up graphical settings since my computer can handle it, but AA makes the screen ""smudgie"" as hell, as if i used smudge tool from photoshop all over the screen.The game has gone from extremely poor server performance during beta, to actually being OK (by ok i mean not noticing really high server lag most of the times). Though lately with the release of the new map as well as other updates server performance is TERRIBLE. Close quarters combat with fast peeking/running around corners is out of question. Constantly dying behind corners and death cam confirms it since your characters is not even visible when the lethal shot goes off (wtf?). Its basically like playing BF2 with 150-300 ping. PUBG is a cash-grab one hit wonder with no ambition to fixing the game. Why do you think they constantly release new payable crates and the new ""season pass""? It's just pure BS to grab more money from the players while they actually live off of the PUBG hype. Half of the items/skins earned from season pass is'nt even permanent (LOL WTF?). They should spend thier energy and time on fixing performance, but they only care for short term sales.I've had my fun in this game. but if i look back to all of the hours i've put into this game, so many games were wasted due to poor performance/dying around corners/game crashes/other stupid bugs killing you for no reason/not being able to reload/not being able to revive team mates/not being able to pick up or drop items... the list goes on forever."

Well, I finally hit my limit of putting up with a game that has mountains of potential, but cannot reach it due to an incompetent dev staff. This game features some of the best gunplay in a modern FPS, but the great mid-range firefights come at the expense of coin-flip short range battles due to a netcode registry that favors higher latency users. It can be a blast to play with friends and a challenging experience in solos, but the highs are high and the lows come far too fast and often when the game gets in the way of its users.Any respectable AAA developer would be working overtime to pinpoint the glaring isssues that have tarnished an otherwise great experience since the beta stage of this title.

The unreliability of the game and my connection are making it impossible to enjoy. I live in Virginia, US and I have only 2 choices for internet if I discount dsl. Yes, 2018 and they are still trying to sell that?????????????????? So, as a consumer, a 40 year old consumer at that with young children growing and a household that normally had internet and cable. I am cutting. As of a couple months from now will be our last for cable and internet will stick for now. However, video games, pc games and all others are out as of today. These companies have vast amounts of power over our political leaders and if they think i will consume and pay for inferior products at higher prices..... well, I can do without. As can my entire household. This review is to let anyone whom has read this far know that video game companies will do what we want, but only if we let them know thru our spending. Good Luck to all and I hope one day to share better days Now the buttons on my mouse arent working. fun times. some new ????????????ing idiot ui that shows the buttons you can use. but it doesnt interact with my razer naga. great ???????????? you too"

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,90,1,-1,618.8,"14 July, 2018","I don't think I've ever played a game where I've been so happy and angry with my gaming experience at the same time.On the one hand, the gunplay is a challenging, competitive experience. No match is the same as your previous one thanks to a random, constantly changing play area. Your strategies to be the last man standing are constantly changing with the change in environment and positioning of other players. It's an intense chess match. I would have to say that these are the most important elements that make this game so addictive.There's something that really pumps your adrenaline up when you've spent 25 minutes running around in one match and now it's you versus the last 5 players. One false route to the next zone could cost you. One decision to drop one scope or another could cost you. A look in the wrong direction for too long could cost you. If you aren't paying 100% attention on your surroundings by the time you get to endgame you could end up wasting the last 30 minutes of your life. You could say this is good and also bad. It definitely raises the stakes of your in-game actions though.On the other hand, this is one of the worst-developed, popular games that I have ever played. It's poorly optimized -- with a 1080Ti, 16GB RAM, and an i5-8700 I am, in my opinion, getting sub-par FPS on low settings. Loot typically takes more than 10 seconds to appear after you have landed on a hot drop. Desync is a common issue that has still yet to be addressed. There's typically not enough competitive loot to be found in the larger maps -- which is a key issue because you may land somewhere and immediately have to move all the way to the other side of the map just to get into the first playzone. Audio is a very important part of this game and the accuracy of it has been very inconsistent to date. There's a lot of small bugs in general which don't necessarily make it unplayable but it's enough to make you wonder what the devs are doing. The developer's focus seems to be on content such as changing the main menu UI, adding new maps, adding purchaseable content. The bug fixes they do make seem to just reappear two patches later.The gameplay's narrative is mostly good. It's a thrilling experience to grind from playzone to playzone trying to survive. I would say that this game thrives on duo experiences. In solos, you could dominate the entire game moving here and there, looting, etc., but there will always be that one guy lying prone somewhere in zone or just sitting in a random corner in a building waiting for you to come along and ruin everything. Squadplay is mainly just difficult at times because you could have 4 people spamming your voice channel, keeping your ears from hearing the important footsteps of enemy players coming in. There's not really any incentive to win other than to be on the top of a leaderboard and earn crates which may or may not give you appearance items that you actually like.All in all, this game has a lot of negatives about it; and while the gunplay, competitiveness, and strategery are great, I can't recommend this game. Those good elements could easily be replicated by a AAA studio with half the bugs, greater community support, better graphics, better physics, and on and on and on. I will say that this is the only battle royale game that I can tolerate to play right now but with new BR titles releasing soon I don't know if you should bother wasting your money on a game with so many problems (and little to no working fixes)."

578080,2,0,7.65612E+16,72,6,-1,768.7,"14 July, 2018","Pubg has been one of my favorites ever since I picked it up back in april of 2017. So it's been over a year and the game is in full release. This is to be taken lightly though, as the game is still riddled with bugs and instabiltiy problems. On my backup pc, I can't even play this game (crashes past launch), due to the mentioned bugginess. The game is fun though, and I've racked up my fair share of hours so far, and soon will reach 700 hours. My problem with the game is the way the developer handles it. The departments for bug fixes and patches appears to work slowly at best, and often take months to fix glaring issues with the game. While the ""in game purchase"" side of the game is flourishing with constant updates and patches to ensure that the up and coming players have their fair chance at spending 60 dollars to buy a skin that my 10 year old cousin could design better. Basically, the customizables feel rushed and cheap at best. In comparrison to another game with skins, Counter Strike comes out far ahead, as their cheap skins look reasonable and function well with the game. Pubg's ""Cheap"" skins are anything but enjoyable, and are a bear minimum that needs to change. Gameplay wise, the game runs fine on my pc with over 90FPS, but occationally stutters here and there. The movement is clunky and the weapons feel like your character has never lifted in his life, making for extremtly bouncy rocoil. I feel the spirit of this game died on full release back in December of 2017. The original crowd that plays this game has mostly either left, or only occationally comes back to play. Personally, I logged at least 16 hours a week playing this game before the full release, but with the change in gamestyle and desync issues, I stopped playing anywhere near as much. To save the game, the Dev team needs to cater to those who play the most of their game, and stop listening to Gaben on how to make money. Listen to your playerbase, or like many other big titles around, you will lose us all together."

This game should not deserve the amount of hate it gets considering that most of the negative reviews I see are Fortnite fan boys, but thats besides the point, the game has great loot spawn rates (except for miramar can't find a gun to save my life) the shooting is great but people say it's bad due to them not knowing that recoil is a thing, kills feel very satisfying not like a run n gun like cod where another kill doesn't feel special, and the way games roll out is insanely fun because hearing someones footsteps in my building scares the??????????????????out of me and makes me feel like my life is on the line like a real gun fight would be like.

Cheaters are still as prevelant as they were in the beginning, nothing has changed there. The UI has changed several times revently and is more complicated than ever.

Well, I guess that would be true if they could actually care about their community. When the game was in early access, it was great. No loot boxes that required keys, no battle passes, not many glaring bug issues which made the game worse. But as time went on, I realized that PUBG doesn't care about its players. All they care about is getting more money. For the life of them, they cannot fix the framerate problems and lag issues. They keep coming out with new maps and new crates which is far from what we need. But with all the money they've gotten in the past year, for some reason they can't fix any of their bugs or lag issues which make most of their players leave. I really love this game and I want it to be successful, but I don't think it will ever be that way. I'm sorry PUBG for giving a bad review, but it has to be done. I'm going to play some Rainbow Six Siege now."

578080,0,0,bashti,84,3,1,578.6,"14 July, 2018",This game still has many flaws. Desync occurs way too often and there is a rather bad connection to the servers in general. The developers are fixing stuff and in some cases they add changes wanted by the community - but they are slow in doing so. Internal rankings are available but the implementation is very simple and could be way more motivating if several changes to the system were made.Besides these problems the game is very much fun and the best Battle Royale Shooter on the market by far.
578080,1,0,CrazyBull11,161,2,-1,202.3,"14 July, 2018","This is a very fun battle royale game. Simply put, there is more emphasis on positioning and playing the circle more than actual aim. While this can be advatageous to players that take advantage of it, the game itself can cause a player playing tactically to die. For example, a player could be hiding in tall grass playing the circle, but die because the grass has not rendered for another player further away, making what you think is  a conceiled position into you becoming a sitting duck for the picking. While some combat situations can be very entertaining, the net code of the game is very subpar. Dying around corners becomes a recurring theme, headshots or body shots for that manner not registering, causing you to die. While this game is very enjoyable, core gameplay is not up to par with other battle royale games which hurts the game severly."

I enjoyed this, but thinks twice before you get this game. You may have fun a long time with this, you may have not. I liked this game ver much.First of all: I've been enjoying this game very much and I won't stop playing this for now.My problem are the little disappointments that came over and over again, eventhough I haven't played the early access. I purchased this game five months ago and I've been playing 250 hours so far. Considering that I also play other games, PUBG took a lot of my gaming free time. Because I like this game very much - generally speaking. But still, there are little things which were annoying. At the time I got this game is was out of early access. Back then, we didn't have a map choosing option. It was okay for me, because both maps were new. Then they gave us that option and lately they took it away from us. At least halfways. I mean, we can choose between the large and the small maps, but if we want to play the large maps, we can't choose which one of them we want to play and it is totally random? Then they give us an option to buy an event pass, so we have the chance to complete missions. Nice idea, but it doesn't make the game better. As far as I understood we are not even allowed to keep all of the skins we can get with this event pass. Some are some super expensive things, which are gone after a certain amount of days. Please correct me if I am wrong.There are more little things I didn't like. But yeah... Like I said, I liked this game so far. It was fun and I will continue playing. I hope all the negative reviews will make the developer or the publisher (or whoever is in charge of that) think. The downside of this is... If the negative reviews kill the community, because nobody is purchasing the game anymore, this game is dead. Nobody wants this to happen. So I hope for the best."

Trying to get all of the money of the playerbase the developers started to ignore the gameplay. Only crates and the event pass got released with the major updates. Of course I understand that the gaming industry is business and not charity. Many bugs are still present in the game, the cheater problem has not got any better (with the exeption of region locking which was an idea by the community and we still had to wait monthes for it to be released into the game). Overall I dont recommend this game DO NOT buy it at full price and the devs only care about your money and doesnt give a single f*ck about the your experience.The dev team will let you down and I wish this game was still before the 1.0 update. And it deserves to be mentioned that I bought this game for the full price in early access. If you are willing to continue a valueable argument please comment and change my opinion. The ""f*ck you"" and ""you are trash at the game"" comments will be ignored. Thank you for your time reading my review. Have a nice day!Edit: Forgot to mention the map chooser which the players waited for way too long and then just got removed because it would be harder to implement into the game and could not be done with 2 clicks after sanhok so the dev team just scrapped it."

Sliding quality has led me to recommend potential buyers to HOLD in the meantime, until PUBG can return to the postive experience.Playing in early access, and throughout it's life, I can say that I have truely enjoyed myself, the highstakes competition, and euphoria of that ""chicken dinner."" The Battlegrounds dev team and Playerunkown himself have put a lot of love and inguinuity into PUBG, its alpha, beta and release--not in the least as the first real attempt at releasing a standalone battle royale game (starting as an ARMA mod of course!). The devs have the right idea with new locations, new guns, new attachments, better auto controls.HOWEVER--followed by a big BUT. I am writing this as a negative recommendation due to the deteriorating quality of gameplay compared to development time: the whole experience has significantly faultered in quality of late. Several massive issue (not including the whole cheaters mess) have slowly grown to what I can call an elephant in this every crowding room: sync issues, confusing Menu and UI, microtransactions, and bait-n-switch item tactics show me that the dev team has not put true heart into what should be considered a battle royale crown-jewel. Metaphorically, you do not use spit and sandpaper to clean a 100 carat dimond.The deteriorating quality of gameplay is a bit of a hearbreak. I emplore the dev team to find new motivation, learn from growing critisism, abandon their eagerness for post-sale monetization, and build the game back to the grand battle royal experience. In the meantime, I would tell fellow gamers to hold their money and invest elsewhere.PS: graphic improvements wouldnt hurt either."

Ability to render more than one person at once in real time is abysmaldon't kid yourself the game is all hype very little substance. Low developer attention span. It's almost like they forget about all the bug reports from the beta and just launched with half a game.(Its only recently that its started to be fleshed out at all and thats just a cash grab anyway.)Not only does it have a price tag but also a subscription model if you want to gain experience and level up otherwise the only way to gain XP is to sit in a game for 2.5 minutes. that earns you 1 XP. out of the 120 to get to level 2. LEVEL ????????????ING 2 Is more than 4 hours of play time. Hows that for a cuck of a paywall. here buy our game. now pay for it again. and on top of that if you want any skins they arent unlockable. no you gotta pay for NOT ONLY CRATES BUT KEYS TOO. Its like it took all of the worst parts of WoW's subscription model and the worst parts of CSGO's loot box and key system and then are now doing their best to get their sticky little fingers even further into your pocket. Cos buying a game isnt enough anymore.(If you could call a game with 1 map and one game mode a full game) Its actually a joke how this is the direction this is going. more cash and a recurring paywall that reactivates every month or 2 with ""seasons"" (lemme translate) What that actually means is your subscription is due or you dont get to level up anymore.TL;DR Buggy, Low IQ Greedy dev's Cashgrab Which coincidentally is wrappped in a package that says its a playable ""game"" But in a multiplayer environment with a 100 man Free for all. it is so poorly designed, optimised and implemented that having more than 5 people in the same area causes your connection to the server to play up.

For me personally it feels like bluehole is trying to compete against Epic Games' Fortnite, with updates like Emotes and a store, (including the mobile game), although most of the updates are very under developed/ rushed, always one step behind or 1 leap worse, it was fun when we had simple pvp gameplay, with game mechanics that only PUBG can offer at the time, but now with Bluehole trying to copy almost exactly what epic games is doing, the game has kind of lost it's purpose, and of course it doesn't help that the devs barely fix bugs, (ex. flying away after being hit by a vehicle, dying from a 3 feet landing, or not even landing at all, etc). However, despite all of this, the game is still fun, although not as exciting as before. I hope that the company will try and focus on fixing gameplay then to compete against other games, but it's not up to me to decide, and with that, I'll opefully see you on the Battlegrounds"

578080,1,1,Mooshe,151,2,-1,202.7,"13 July, 2018",is it possible to disable a game from ever being installed again on steam
578080,3,0,kooper364,203,5,-1,289.7,"13 July, 2018","Been playing this game for a while now, here's my take:The good:- Squad matches can be tons of fun, can't speak for solo as I haven't played it all that much.- It can become really immersive, especially when you find yourself trying to figure out from which location the sound of an enemy's footsteps or gunshots are coming from.- If you don't take it too seriously, it can at times remain fun regardless of the (admittedly) frequent bugs.- Loot exists, but it is nothing more than cosmetic, which means you cannot pay-to-win if you play by the rules (more on this in a bit).The bad:- If you have money burning a hole in your pocket, you can buy nonsensical loot crates containing nothing more than cosmetic items. Not really a bad thing necessarily, but you can waste your money, should you be so inclined.- Expect the game to crash on you for no good reason, with such magnificient error messages as ""bad client"" and ""kicked player"" for your reading enjoyment. Do not expect to ever gain any understanding of what those messages really mean, as no one seems to know.- The amount and size of updates this game has is ludicrous. You'll open up Steam, see there's been a 5GB or 9GB patch, and most times you wouldn't notice any of that data going towards improving the overall experience in any tangible way whatsoever. Sure, new content might pop up from time to time in the form of new maps, guns, vehicles, cosmetic items to play dress-up with your character and so on, but none of the patches seemingly go towards fixing the fundamental problems this game has had for quite some time now.The ugly:- As it turns out, you CAN pay-to-win in this game. ""What do you mean, fine sir?"" you might be (but probably aren't) asking. Well, you can expect to find players (seemingly mostly from a specific location that starts with a ""C"" and rhymes with ""China"") using speedhacks, auto-aim, x-ray, teleport, and I'm not %100 sure about this one, but I swear some might even use the old IDDQD god mode at times.- Hit-reg is utterly atrocious at times. Expect to unload 4 or 5 headshots from a shotgun directly into an opponent's face without it having any effect of any sort. The result: You get killed with a one-shot from a pistol, you end up having to buy a replacement keyboard and/ or mouse and/ or monitor, and you may even end up uninstalling the game in a fit of rage, only to install it again a few months later in the misguided hope of the game having improved to the point where your gaming rig wouldn't be at risk of high velocity impact with a hammerfist or forehead.- Network lag. Dear lord, the network lag. I'll paint the scene: You have a perfect opportunity to unleash the fury of a thousand suns upon an unsuspecting enemy player. You line up the enemy and confirm that your AR is in full-auto. You click, expecting to hear an orchestra of gunshots and seeing a thick red mist of blood splatter, except the shots you're firing halt abruptly, your character freezes, the screen dims slightly, and you're greeted with a message stating ""Network lag detected"". HOWEVER, the network lag is not bad enough to prevent you from seeing the enemy player lining you up in cinema-smooth movement, taking shot after shot at you at leisure, then finally seeing the enemy looting what is now the miserable, lifeless corpse of what used to be your character. Loads of fun, this particularly.Conclusion:Can be fun, frustrating, and infuriating in equal measure. It's an unfinished game being sold as a finished product. Will it ever be finished? Doubt it. PUBG ever reaching a finished and polished state is this generation's Half Life 3: Maybe it will happen one day, maybe it won't. It probably won't."

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,75,2,-1,45.7,"13 July, 2018","Okay, I have waited a long time to write a review on PUBG... almost 1600 hours at the time of posting.  The recent PGI patch (including their ping ""fix"" patch) and the release of Sanhok has ruined this game for me.  Sanhok, great map (best yet), excellent combat, great circle transitions (most of the time), good cover, overall just a great job on the map... The problem is with the devs just blatantly allowing high ping (even after they ""fixed"" the ping-based matchmaking).  The desync on the NA servers, I'm from the US, is so bad that there is sometimes 1 to 2 seconds delay between you having been behind cover and getting shot...  I have many times been engaged, run to cover, start healing and get killed/downed from the other side of the wall...  Now, I have played Fortnite, when it first released and a handful of times recently, and you can feel that they are putting money back into the game.  Several months ago, I had brought up to my squad mates that I felt like Bluehole was using almost all of PUBG profits on another project... then began the rumors of AIR (the Bluehole MMO).  You can certainly see that the betterment of PUBG is second to them wanting to make another Korean MMO.  MMO's are extremely expensive and with the state of PUBG you can tell they are dumping money into AIR instead of back into PUBG (other than jamming more microtransactions down your throat for more money for AIR).  Every squad match played without friends is almost certain to get a squad full of Chinese speaking teammates.  This leads to you constantly repeating yourself, jumping crazy after dropping extra scopes at their feet, them running right into enemies you JUST called out, or just them completely being mute...  I know what you are thinking, great for a game that needs squad communication very heavily.  I still do not understand why they even give an option for changing your region... After a patch, it almost always defaults EVERY client back to NA (or some other region, instead of defaulting to YOUR region) resulting in tons of latency stress on the servers because NO ONE changes the default region after the patch.  This just leads to extremely questionable and unpleasant matches.  Sure, sometimes you might get lucky and survive a desync encounter but then you just get hip fire sniped from across the map running from the playzone. The game just isn't being managed very well, even other games that had bad issues with desync and netcode issue that made it appear to be being shot from around corners fixed this problem much sooner than Bluehole; thinking of BF4 release as a prime example (took a while but certainly not over 1 year).  If you invest the time in the game, know that you certainly will not get a similar investment back from the devs.  Coming from someone who has ~1600 hours and have been decently ranked on the leaderboards (top 100 several times) if you are thinking of purchasing and haven't yet, look for another battle royale game."

The console version was clearly rushed in order to make the maximum amount of profit also the game was broken on release and is still broken from what I seen low 20s in the frame rate and visuals over frame rate for some reason don't quote me on this but there are also frame time issues I think? The servers are even worse on console rubberbanding on console is torture and the input delay is horrible from pressing legit any button. This is the first time I'm going to say this I feel bad for console gamers the version of pubg on console is pathetic sad excuse and for some reason console gamers accept the worse of the worse version for some reason their ideology is flawed most of the time they get hyped over a game and ignore its issues for some reason remember ark survival evolved that game was so incredible broken and still is yet console gamers accept it, it baffles me. Conclusion the company is shady as the term shady barely fix there game and barely acknowledge the glaring issues the game has its legit EA we will improve give us time instead they just release more garbage like EA? Also wtf is wrong with the main menu why does it take like 1 to 5 minutes to open a (""crate""/lootbox) like why does it take forever for anything to register in the main menu switching between maps legit can give error like what I'm switching between maps and it takes like 5 seconds that may seem low but when your consistently switching maps to grind the ""event pass"" nice copying by the way, this can get insanely annoying and why does the refresh lobby button still exist the lobby system is still busted. I can rant on hours of the amount of cheaters imagine this, there are 100 players in a lobby one is a cheater for the entire game you reach top 10 and die instantly to a headshot their goes like 30 minutes of your time annoying is it not and there can even be mutiple cheaters in a game keep in mine theres 100 or suppose to be players 1/100 chance each time you join a game there will be a cheater or some person from across the world rubber banding like a mad man and head shots you while you can't even hit them or on rare occasion see them.

From 600 hours of gameplay plus another 600 of watching people stream the game on Twitch, I believe I can pinpoint the type of person who would enjoy it.PUBG is for gamers who enjoy:  - the thrill of an extremely hard-earned victory - the challenge of playing against other humans in PVP - the freedom to play as aggressively or passively as they prefer, and still be rewarded - the freedom to go anywhere you wish and try different strategiesAnd perhaps most importantly: - the chance to constantly improve and adapt after failure and defeatThere is a lot of failure and defeat in this game.  There are some bugs too, but I personally am not bothered too much by the bugs.  I quit playing when the hacking was out of control, but it improved quickly.  The bugs are very annoying, but you can learn to play around them.  If you are someone who rages when things do not go your way, do not play this game.  You will get beat a lot, mostly because of your own mistakes.  There are enough bugs that it is very easy to blame the bugs instead of your mistakes, and if you fall into that trap you will never get any  better.  So if you rage easily, don't waste your time.A note on PUBG Corp and their failure to fix issues:  the game is most popular in China, and in China Third Person Perspective (TPP) is the most popular mode.  Players put a lot of stock in their appearance.  PUBG is filling this need through pay-to-look-good options.  Players who enjoy the more competitive FPP rarely see themselves and care much less about clothes and more about game performance.  PUBG has, predictably, focused more on the money than on optimization.  Like the many negative reviews on Steam, I agree that PUBG is making a mistake in this regard; however, unlike most of the reviews, I still enjoy playing the game."

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,38,1,1,255.9,"17 October, 2018","This game is getting a bunch of negative reviews.  Here's my take:  I've played off and on for about a year.  It's improved a lot.   Lots of new weapons, vehicles, clothing, and a total of three maps.  I find that all the maps provide a much different experience, and are all enjoyable.People complain about cheaters, desync, the devs, and a whole load of other stuff.  I don't know for sure whether I've been killed by a cheater yet or not.  Usually, I die because I did something stupid, gave away my position, fired when I didn't have a certain kill shot, or drove straight into enemy fire.  I've gotten first place, I've gotten 99th place.  I usually kill zero to 1 player a game, so by no means am I an ""elite"" player, and probably wouldn't rank as even a ""good"" player.  But I feel that I'm getting better simply by knowing the maps so well.  I enjoy the stealth aspect, and sneaking my way into the top 10 even if I never fired a shot.I very much enjoy the solo rounds, but it's a lot of fun to team up with friends to wreak havoc.  Nothing like completely disagreeing on strategy, three people sneaking, while one is running wide open and engaging everyone they find.  Lots of laughs, as well as very intense moments.Overall, if I have a free evening, I'll gladly board onto the PUBG plane, jump out, and fight it out with 99 other souls.  Other games I enjoy are X-Com 2, Darkest Dungeon, TF2, and Skyrim."

The game starts off as a good high. You drop down, maybe kill a few guys, rank top 10 for the round and you feel good. You feel the excitement and tension as the world closes in around you forcing you to fight off other players. At the end, you feel like you accomplished something and you join the next round to get a little bit further, chasing that high. Then after a while you score your first chicken dinner, you win! Last man standing, king of the hill, the BEST! The game has already corrupted your mind and spirit by this point. You've been chasing that chicken dinner screen for weeks and that feeling you get when you finally get the win again doesn't feel the same. It doesn't last as long and the reward for reaching it feels meaningless. if the gameplay is the crack, then the in-game store is the crack dealer. Encourging you to buy keys to unlock boxes that may or may not contain a piece of digital clothing or weapon skin you covet for no reason. So you play more to get more points so you can return to the dealer and see what your addiction has rewarded you with. The same M16 skin or pair of bluejeans that you've received for the 15th time. But you don't care, you continue chasing the high that will never return.If you've bought this game, don't play it. If you've played it, stop before you can't.

Now, if I was rich and owned a gaming company I'd totally take advantage of these soi-boy grease-cheeks. Just think of the money you can make from their pathetic lives. So Bluehole decides to screw off with the battle-royal idea and they become a company that created this thing you install on your computer named ""PUBG"".

I find this game better than fortnite due to the current state fortnite is in and how the developers are making it a more luck based game but then again pubg has its flaws such as personally i find more lag playing pubg and also being absolutely destroyed in seconds but then again its all about skill in this game fortnite is a bit diferent in the way it works with bloom and random damage so overall this game i find is better than fortnite but i believe it should either be free or they should lower the price.

The developers are amateurs who cannot even stop a simple ESP hack that has plagued the game since launch.  a client side spectator system basically makes the hacks built into the game.  Something a basic game designer should know. Problem is these people are basement modders at best. They have no idea how to move information server side without draining FPS or increasing the already rediculous lag. Hackers love this lag because the incompotent players and hackers use it as a defense to say hacking doesnt take place.  HAcks i see every game: ESP, free fall speed increase, increased damage, decreased incoming damage. Aim alert, aim assist, weapon spawning, no clipping, dereased footsteps. This doesnt even included the blatant stuff like recoil removal and flying cars. This game is going to suffer a horrible death if they do not get their stuff straight. Simple hitbox register is so bad in this game, you can stand behind a pole a few inches in size and it will almost cut your hit detection in half. Many shots do no even register in the other persons client.  You can unload a clip on someone , and they will fire one shot and kill you. Go back and watch the replay and it will show you never fired a shot even though your own client thinks you did. Ill play every once in a while right after a patch is released and you can usually get a few hours or even a days worth of play before the hackers return. FPP use to be safe but now hackers moving into it as well. using a +144hz monitor is the only way you can play this game. I run a 240hz monitor and it helps a lot with input lag, but i know most players arent paying 900+ for a monitor. ILSE, COD, BF, and everything else comming soon will leave no room for this trash."

The gunplay is pretty satisying.2. The core gameplay focus that is make it to be the last one standing is fun3. The baseline graphics are pretty goodCons (aka the long list):1. Horribly unoptimiized for being in full release (if it was still early access this would be negligable)2. When they added in the new map at full release they removed the fun fog and rain variants of the original map3. Referring to #2, they have not added back any kind of Constant Weather variants to the maps despite the Sanhok proving that it is possible.4. There are spikes of Hackers whenever they release a new loot crate.5. Constant security updates that do little to deter hackers6. A horrendous loot crate system that doesnt give you a decent return for duplicate items7. Duplicate items from crates8. Lack of feeling of progression/reward outside of matches9. Locked Loot crates IN THE STANDARD LOOT CRATE POOL that require you to pay upfront for the CHANCE to get a cosmetic item.10.

It's my opinion that a fps/tps game today has to set itself apart from others not just from a gameplay sense, but a visual sense as well. Sadly this is too realistic to call it unique, and almost feels like it would fit in with CoD or any other generic war game. There are several maps to play on with different weather settings at random, but these worlds however can feel barren and even too large at times. Plus playing with weather effects such as the fog is just annoying. Gameplay has too much going on to a point where the casual player is simply confused, especially with the game's controls. Understand this is an important thing to have in a game in order to have more active players over time, otherwise it can scare away new players. Hours in and I still seem to have no idea what I'm doing or what button does what. End of the day, this game feels almost generic with little to set it apart from other games besides the gameplay being a battle royale format. Maybe some like it, but I can't say I'm a fan of it."

The developers have gotten extremely greedy and have opened lawsuits against any and all other games that decide they want to make a battle royale game too. One of these game developers was the poeple that make Fortnite, and coincidentally the very same people that do a lot of back-end support for PUBG. Since this lawsuit began PUBG has withdrawn their file, but their game has strangely gone down the gutter since then. They blatantly steal ideas from Fortnite and other games, including making a Battle Pass (which requires you to grind 8 hours a day for 30 hours straight to get the top-tier rewards WITHOUT spending money), and smaller Fortnite-sized maps. Hacking isn't as big of a problem, but it is still a big one.

578080,3,0,sillyfuck,143,1,-1,670,"12 July, 2018","Despite how many hours I have in this game, I have nothing but utter contempt for it and that is for a multitude of reasons. The first is that the game in its current state, or rather, since it was first officially released out of early access, has awful lag problems. You will find yourself getting shot around walls, corners, and experiencing terrible desync quite frequently. The second reason for which I do not recommend this game, is that the devs quite honestly have no idea what they are doing in every domain. Every update they release only hinders game performance, and hilariously enough breaks more things than they fix. This is in addition to the fact that they seem much more preoccupied with releasing more ?????????????????? crates and skins rather than actually fixing critical gameplay and performance problems. The third and final reason is both a mixture of the way the game balance has devolved (also because of the devs' stupid decisions), and the hackers that infest this game. In relation to the game balance issues, the game has only gone downhill since release. The many nerfs to guns such as the m16, m4, etc, and the addition of ridiculous amounts of aimpunch when getting hit make for a more unenjoyable experience. Another thing in regards to this point, is that the devs finally made a good change to the circle dynamic in their newest map, but then did not change the way the circle works in the other maps, therefore leaving in a bad mechanic. Lastly, it matters not which perspective you play in (for the record, I play only FPP), this game is filled to the brim with hackers, with most of them being Chinese. When faced with this fact, the devs simply shirked away from taking action, thus letting cheaters run rampant to no end, and having people from the other side of the globe play on the NA server, putting even more stress on this game's already awful netcode. In short, this game is fun for a little bit if you have some friends to play it with, as this somewhat lets you overcome this game's massive issues. Once the honeymoon phase is over, you will end up hating this game, and because of this, it is better not to even waste money on it. If my friends were not as invested in this game for as long as they were, I would have stopped playing this dumpster fire of a game much earlier than I did."

People will blame hitreg for the game trying to center a single ping instead of both players in the fight having 2 different pings. The game is actually doing it's job and tbh doing it well considering 90% of the player base is either in china or across the country from the pubg NA server itself. PUBG's server lag is different, it's pretty bad but overall is a pretty good game and can be flukey at times and you will ""look"" like you just got shot around a corner when really it's just what the enemy see's not what you see. So please, don't be cancer and just blame lag because it's ""mostly"" not the games fault and your just a bad player. Also don't say its bad when you only have 150 hrs because you have no where near enough hours to be able to judge a game. It's good, has its flaws, and will fix them when they can.

578080,0,0,therealblaze,9,2,1,181,"12 July, 2018","IN MY OPINION..this game was one of the greatest multiplayer game ever, let alone as best Battle Royale game. it wasn't boring since everytime you landed on the map it's different possibilities(mostly dead). The mechanics and logic are on point, I love this kind of game rather than a game where you start on small map and finish the round, a same repetetive and small possibilities.Like I said, it was a great multiplayer, means it was the best if you played with your friends. Random matching kinda lame to me. Also playing solo is boring af IMO. This game can make a new player feels the chills runs down their spine for a long time, my hands are shaking right after my first few game. It was so intense and fun that I could wet my pants.(I'm stlll shaking)I do realize that people are being mad on the devs coz of the hacker issue, well I never met one but that doesn't mean they dont exist here.

I don't like Fortnite, but at least the devs care and listen to the community. They also don't sue people for being in the same genre. Pubg's battlepass clone lasts half as long, gives 1/3 of the levels, has no chance to get the next one by earning with the pass, and the items it gives are boring, the only thing this game's customization system has over Fortnite is the ability to customize your  your outfits.

But damn was I wrong.As time went by I grew tired of all the bugs, desync problems, poor optimization (which we all had to ????????????ing fix by ourselves) and when 1.0 dropped I just couldn't play the game. Right after the update dropped, I launched the game and it got stuck in the loading screen. Gave it a couple more tries but nothing. Straight out uninstalled, I didn't even want to spend one more second trying to fix their??????????????????Today, after almost 8 months, I decide to give it another try and guess what, this??????????????????still doesn't work. I'm mad at myself for helping these guys pull the biggest scam i've ever seen, and I'm sorry for the death of a brilliant idea.Don't spend money on things that don't work."

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,3,4,-1,169.9,"12 July, 2018","I tryed my hardest to play this game. Even after the new map release update, the same problems that I always had were still present. I don't know much about code or anything like that, so when it comes to reviews that involve people talking bad about this games code I can't really relate. But what I can tell you from my own personal experience is that this games optimization is horrible. Micro stutters seem to always appear when you get into a gun fight. And seeing as how this games purpose is gun confrontation, thats a huge problem. But the main problem I have with this game is how horribly designed the mechanics are. It seems like the hit box for what you shoot at is bigger and then other times smaller at multiple different times, never accurate. You could be aiming down your scope literally right at someones head, pull the trigger and the bullet misses. On the other hand, i've also experienced getting shot in the head multiple times by people who don't have there sights anywhere near my head, yet the bullet seems to magically hit my head and kill me. And these are just a coupple of the problems that are present in this game. And I'm not speaking 1 sided here either. These experiences have been both things that have happened to me, as well as things i've done to other players. And everytime it happens I shake my head in huge dissapointment especially when I do it to another player. Because I know that if I have ""magical bullets"" most likely everyone else does to. Then you have the times where you're taking cover behind an object. You move out from your cover area to shoot, then you run back behind the object completely out of line of sight of your enemy, to reload and then like .3sec later they fire at you and you miraculously die from their gunshots. And yes....that is exactly how it sounds. You're behind an object, and their bullets still hit you within a small window of miliseconds. Its horrible design if I ever seen it and this ultimately causes me to not take the game seriously.I've gotten to the top 3 and even the top 2 quite afew times in my own pubg matches. But I have never won the chicken dinner and now I don't even care to anymore. Because it seems like whenever I play this game, I get screwed over by something that is out of my control and power. And because of this I do not reccomend this game. If it was maybe 10$ and crate keys were cheaper, then yeah I'd probably reccomend it. But in its current state, slapping a 30$ price tag on it and then charging people 2.50$ to buy a key to open locked crates is a complete rip off considering the game just isn't ready. I find it hard to believe they actually hold tournaments for this game. Its horrible design makes me wonder about that...But this is all just my opinion. They main thing I would like to make known to people who are thinking about buying this game is this: Don't expect much, and watch your hours played. If you play it and then quickly feel like its not worth the money, get a refund before its too late because your right to refund will dissapear once you hit a certain amount of hours played. So buy at your own risk."

578080,0,0,amila93,6,4,1,52,"12 July, 2018","I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews. For me, this game is great. Need some improvements such as bug fixes and optimizations but PUBG dev team seems to be working on them constantly, therefore can't complain about that. I'm saying that because I installed this game when this is in early access and played a bit then stopped. Installed this recently (after few months) and experienced a huge noticable performence gap.In game FPS and ping counter is missing very badly in this game. Other than that this game is getting better."
578080,4,0,bb363,24,2,-1,538.6,"12 July, 2018","This Game was the best thing that happened to my steam library when it first came out. I was reccomened to pick up the game from some buds i met playing League, saying it was a hell of a time and, at that time, it was actually true.This was almost a year ago. The game had exploded, and it seemed like the new amazing game that would last for years, given consistent support.Notice how I said ""Consistent Support""The Game was far from perfect, but it had plenty of room for improvement, the game had come out rather recently, and it had the time and funds for the Devs to improve. This game was the driving factor in my push away from the cancer that is LoL, which has sucked up all of my free time for the past 3 years. PUBG was The god of twitch, and it seemed like it would take a higher being to dethrone it.Ill stop beating around the bush, you all get the point, Blah blah blah pubg great game.The Devs Push unnecessary content and cosmetics, but its a nice addition because the game didnt have much depth at the point, so anything was appreciated. It's one thing to add cosmetics to the game, but to change The HUD, the lobby, and the way the map looks when you fullscreen it for no reason just doesn't make the game better. the reasons the game had grown so big wasnt off of small things that bring nothing to the game. This game grew to the giant it was because it was a unique concept, and they weren't doing anything to improve that concept.The game slows down growth due to lack of bugfixes and optimization, only so many people have a system that can run this game. Bluehole, ????????????????????????, blueballs, whatever you use to describe them, they just dont do anything to improve the game's fatal flaws, and it was only a matter of time before they had to ramp it up or be the ramp for a game to overtake them.The only major updates that brought new mechanics to the concept was the vaulting, which was just a bad system and poorly made to bandage an exploit that allowed people to jump higher and through windows, known as crouch jumping. they added a new map which just seemed a rushed effort to get content out.Fortnite. i never liked it, but i agree that it is overall just a better made game. while Bluehole pushed out microtransactions, Epic pushed out a polished game that wasn't just a proof of concept, but rather a concept matured (not the playerbase though)Fortnite was easier to run, had more depth, and had a half decent dev working to improve the game.these trends would continue, and while PUBG imploded, Fortnite Exploded, The hackers Wallets became loaded.With a game that makes in-game points worth cosmetics, which can be sold on the steam market, people want to make as many points so that they can sell their cosmetics/crates. This happens to be killing everyone on the map from any place, as fast as possible, and for the average player, this was just not going to fly. the game had a Sort-of competitive enviroment, and cheating isn't taken too kindly. But the devs did nothing. you can find these complaints going back over 9 months, and it drove the game into the ground.Pubg was anything but a complete game. If anything at this point, it was a proof of concept. proof that this game COULD succeed, but Bluehole didnt improve their concept, and let it sit there, printing money for them, and sat on that money without doing anything to improve the game.as many people have said in these reviews, we all wish we could like this game. nobody denies that this game could have been even bigger, given that dev support. Bluehole failed to expand, realized they were in a losing fight against competition, and milked the game instead of trying to fix it. As for driving to quit league, i'd happily inform you that i still ????????????ing hate that i still play it, and am still hardstuck silver 5. This game was the best thing to happen to my steam library, and i wish i could still enjoy this. the new map is the only thing still keeping me playing this, but when the map is smaller, the range the hackers have to shoot is drastically smaller.this game had everything in their hands. id like to end sayingBluehole had 2 shotsThey could have shot:HackersBugsANYTHING THAT CAUSED THE GAME TO BE BADBut instead, they shot:The playerbaseThemselves."

It's fun, when you get the hang of it, and if you are like me and are more of a ""understand the flow of battle"" rather than a straight up twitch fighter (meaning you have good reaction times and are able to aim like you are cheating even when you aren't) then this game will probably end up giving you some fun fights.However, the publisher/dev are terrible. They have this huge success on their hands, and the game still runs like crap, still has major bugs, still has textures that look like they came from a Playstation 2, still has cheaters, and still has the same bunch of maps they have had for a while now.On top of that, it is a lootbox game. Sure, the lootboxes are cosmetic, but since part of the game (hiding) involves having the right kind of comsetics, this does affect gameplay, and the system is just... really not meant to be fair to players.On top of THAT are PUBG's lawsuits against other Battle Royale games. They enter into these snarky lawsuits for nothing more than jealousy, it looks like, and their game isn't the best BR game out there.I'm not going to tell you to go play a certain game other than this if you want a good Battle Royale game, because I don't have to. There are other games out there that do this better that are just as fun. Hell, they have a ROBLOX BR game. PUBG is old news.Save your money and your time. Go elsewhere if you value either."

Bluehole had an opportunity to create a game that stood the test of time. But with the lack of community transparency and the lack of oblivious known issues that needed hotfixes, this game went straight into becoming a money grab. Instead of fixing known exploits in their maps, they introduce loot crates. Of course, you have to pay to open. Instead of doing a normal region lock on the servers that the community begged and pleaded for, the creator told its player base that they are racist people for not allowing international IPs to play in domestic servers. Taking weeks almost months for a general hotfix that could have saved it's player base. This game was enjoyable at first. Now it's all about d-sync and hacking issues within its servers that Bluehole and PUBG are taking forever to fix. Let's put it this way: it took PUBG almost a full year (from beta access) to implement an ""anti-cheat system"" and it didn't even work for the first couple of months of implementation. There are a lot of reasons that PUBG's competitor, Epic Game's Fortnite, is beating them even after completely changing their platform of Fortnite. Some people don't remember Fortnite's original genre. It was a survival horde game with a linear storyline and had a horrendous multiplayer which was the same thing but just playing with friends. They implimented their battle royale multiplayer servers and it was hit. Not only because it was free-to-play, but Epic Games listened to their community and did the hotfixes that needed to be done to help players play the game with ease and comfort without d-sync and hacking. Yes, there are hackers in Fortnite, there are always going to be hackers in multiplayer PC game, but you can for damn sure rely on Epic to solve these issues a lot faster and a lot swifter than Bluehole and PUBG could ever do.Would I recommend this game? No. Go play fortnite. It's free. It's practically the same game with a different twist. and it's developer knows a thing or two about keeping it's playerbase happy.This game had so much potential but because of the money hungry company that never listened to it's community and instead implemented cash grabs within its game, this game is now trying to catch up in popularity that it once started.Good job PUBG and Bluehole.

It is fun to play and I have great times with friends.But I can't get over their idiotic decisions.  The game runs fine on my PC and the gameplay isn't destroyed by bugs.  But when I have spent probably 20+ hours checking to see if servers are up so I could play and so were my friends.  I get a world exists outside of the USA.  But the USA exists also.  You cannot ALWAYS do updates during primetime.  And they take forever.  Even tiny ones that are not necessary to have their own update.And the one I am currently waiting on.  What is the big, huge update?  A change to the end time of an event.  That's it.  When is it happening?  During peak hours of US playtime.But I know I am going to continue to play.

Every time there's an update for the game or at random times, the servers are down for hours. This is the only game that I play that has this many issues with connectivity.Also, the lootbox system is offensive as hell. Usually how it goes is that you can buy lootboxes for cosmetic items, or play enough and recieve in-game currency to buy them. I've always felt that system was fair for multiplayer games. With this one however first you pay for the lootbox, then you pay for the key to open it. That is such utter horsecrap."
578080,0,0,hoodjuro,82,4,1,146.5,"11 July, 2018","PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale shooter which can be played in first or third person perspective. The fact that its battle royale means you'll face off alone or as a team against other players on a large map. Each match consists of 100 players facing off against each other to claim the #1 spot. When you start a match you are dropped onto a large island by plane. Where you are dropped is up to you though, since you can jump from the drop plane at any point and decide where to land with your parachute. From this point the rat race begins as you hurry to find any means to defend yourself against other players that may have dropped near you. You simply never know what around the next corner. So being well prepared is a good idea, and be prepared for the worst at that. You can find a variety of weapons at the numerous locations on the island, from machetes to assault rifles. Aside from weapons you can find different ways of protecting yourself in the form of helmets and bullet proof vests. These come in 3 different levels of protection. You'll need these to give you the edge over the competition, so finding level 3 protective gear is in your best interest. Speaking of survivability, you can find various types of healing items aswell. When you take heavy fire but manage to escape by the skin of your teeth, these items will help you get back on your feet and continue the fight. You have your standard med kits, but there are also energy drinks, which replenishes your health over time, and can even give you a movement speed boost if you chug away enough of them. Vehicles are also present and will be needed to escape groups of hostile players and the dreaded blue circle which you will be running from over the course of a match. This blue circle will shrink in size as the game goes on, and being outside the blue circle will drain your health. Not so much in the beginning, but as the circle gets smaller the damage over time also increases. Therefore the circle is super important to keep you eye on later in the game. It forces the players closer and closer together and will ultimately force a confrontation between the last standing players. Being one of the last survivors really puts you on edge and you'll want to win, especially if you've come this far. As if the blue circle and all the players out to get you weren't enough, on occasion red circles will appear on the map. These indicate that this particular zone will be bombed. If you find yourself in this zone, your best bet is seeking shelter indoors or getting out of it ASAP. You can imagine all these element make for a fun and addictive gameplay loop, and it will make you want to go for another round to get that elusive #1 spot. Playing with friends is the best way to experience most multiplayer games and this one is no exception. Being able to strategize with your team and plan your next move as the circle is closing in is a very satisfying experience and one that pays off. That said the game is not perfect and suffers from some lag issues from time to time. There are also instances where you can get stuck on the environment or take unnecessary damage trough some wonky hitboxes and physics. These things can happen from time to time and can certainly diminish your enjoyment of the game. Especially when you are on a losing streak and you get a cheap death trough one of the game's many bugs. Be mindful of that, but let it also be known that the core game is a ton of fun regardless. When all works well, you can have a blast and you'll find the hours flying by as you keep pushing yourself to be number one. Be it solo or as a team, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as you try and survive and end up on top and get that famous chicken dinner!"

Not even for free I would play it. The funny part of it is that you do not need to be experimented to have a chance to succeed. If you avoid all conflicts with other players, hide and run just to stay into the marked area and arrived in it in time , you can still win the game or finish in the second or third position. it is totally random for an outcome and for sure every game you will play would be different. Maybe the only fight you can have would be with the last people arriving into the final circle if they don t kill each others or explode on their vehicles. Lots of bugs. There is few parts I like in that kind of game. Like the one when you don t really play the game but mess with other players by just stealing their car, motorbike, buggy when they are looting a place and just run away wth it, not even having the intention of getting to the marked area, just the fun of stealing their car and explore. Finishing by destroying it and having those victims players unable to make it in time to the marked area maybe wondering if they made it out.Anyway, I was looking forward to play that game and it is now in my library not even wanting to touch it or finding it attractive."

Initially it was a lot of fun, but then people found out they could make money on the game by hacking. Then the game became dominated by hackers. So they tried to fix the hacking issue, only to make every other aspect of this game astronomically worse in terms of optimization and playability. There is EXTREME amounts of lag, fps drop (even on my GTX 1070 graphics cards on very low graphics settings), and the game has become truly unplayable, which is rather disappointing considering I used to have a lot of fun playing it.Instead of focusing their efforts on optimizing the game, the developers have chosen to implement silly ""event passes"" that cost $10 a month, in addition to loot crates that cost $2.00 to open that have outnumbered the free crates astronomically, which are ultimately just another cash-grab before the game inevitably dies, as it should.If the developers want to save this game, they desperately need to optimize this game, balance loot spawns, implement some sort of reward for winning (i.e. a special ""chicken dinner crate"" that is FREE to OPEN.) There is truly no incentive to play this game anymore unless you're willing to pay, and when there's free-to-play games like Fortnight out there, dont waste your money on PUBG."

It has good elements but it still feels like it is in early access to me."

578080,0,0,RomanticAc,287,3,-1,244.3,"11 July, 2018","PUBG is a game that I spent a significant amount of time in and watched it grow from its true early access form to its half-way released mess that it has become as of the time of writing this review. TL;DR, I would not recommend this game based on the microtransactional model which the developers/publishers Microtransactions have many flavors and styles that are different for each developer and publisher, some are more friendly to players than others. Many people do not have a problem with microtransactions as a whole and in 2018, microtransactions are par for the course in the gaming industry. However as a gamer I have seen many different microtransactional systems and I would argue that PUBG has gone with the model which least fits the genre and style of its game. PUBG's closest competition is a completely free to play game, Fortnite. Fortnite uses a model where each item has a set price on the Fortnite store and has a season pass system similar to the one introduced to PUBG with the Sanhok update. Unlike Fortnite however PUBG uses an additional system where you earn chests through gameplay but they will randomize the chests you recieve from your gameplay. Some of these chests require $2.50 for a key to open the chest but you do not get to choose to recieve only chests which do not require keys or chests with keys. Meaning you could play for multiple days and get the maxmium weekly amount of chests for that week but not get a single chest which you can open without spending more money. This practice alone is why I do not recommend the game. Had PUBG gone with a free-to-play model I would not complain, I would say that it is a fair compromise for a game offered for free. However this game, as of writing, costs $30. And it is not fair to introduce event passes and paid chests in a game which already has a healthy market for cosmetics and has one of the largest player base for a PC early-access game in the history of Steam, making record after record for concurrent players. This game feels as if it is merely trying to cash out the check of its popularity with monetary schemes which in my opinion are unfair for players and are a slap in the face to anyone who has been with this game since the start. Literally the only thing I ask for is that you be able to choose whether you would recieve a reward of a chest with paid keys or not. This would return fairness to the loot system of the game. In terms of gameplay it isnt that great anymore, the Time-to-kill when someone starts firing on you is rarely if ever long enough to mount any sort of defense so essentially the gunplay has evolved into an elaborate game of hide and seek where unless you are extremely lucky someone seeing and firing at you before you see them means instant death and a waste of possibly 30 minutes of game time amounting to nothing more than a paltry sum of battle points which can't even be used fairly, as outlined above."

578080,11,0,BumblB,627,21,-1,211.7,"11 July, 2018","I have owned PUBG from the very week it entered in to early access and have subsequently played around 200 hours on various early access and ""full release"" builds and I can tell you this game is a con of the highest degree.PUBG feels like a student project that has continued to stumble through and gain momentum as there are no other challenges from a Battle Royale game in this style - Fortnite has stratospherically taken off, however the overall pacing, mechanics and visuals are vastly different to PUBG.This game is run by the most incompetent developers. There are bugs and glitches here that have been present from the game's Early Access launch and I can only imagine this far in to the games lifecycle that they will never be fixed. Basic, fundamental concepts to PUBG are sometimes *literally* impossible to achieve in game; from being unable to revive team mates, vehicles flying 300ft in the air after driving over an empty field, items not spawning, healing items not activating, bullets travelling through players, grenades not going off, audio (most importantly, footsteps) not working at all and so much more. To me, it is genuinely astounding just how much PUBG Corp have managed to mess up this concept when the game took off like a rocket when it originally launched on Steam.Bugs aside, if you have played an online multiplayer game in the past 10-15 years, I implore you to go nowhere near this sham. Did you ever play a online game on your Nintendo Wii? There is a 95% chance it will run better than this steaming heap of incompetence. Go on to Reddit, YouTube or Twitch and take a look at some PUBG clips surrounding desync - players are being shot around walls, buildings, rocks, trees, vehicles, etc.  The spectator/replay cam shows players firing 5-10ft behind someone else, with blood spouting out of thin air as if the devil himself is wearing Harry Potter's invisibility cloak and you are accidentally hitting him and not your intended target. Desync not bad enough? Let's talk about bullets. Where do they go? I fire bullets that are very, very clearly going through the skull of another player - do the bullets vanish?  Does the enemy consume them and regain health?  Are they bouncing my shots back at me? That's okay though, because when I go around the corner to reload I will die from behind the wall as the player shoots where I was standing 5 seconds prior.Another issue is audio.  Audio was previously functioning and now it is not.  How you ask?  I have literally no idea. What I can tell you is that some players have zero footstep noise, they could be walking 10cm beside you and you will not hear them as they seemingly levitate above the ground.  Meanwhile, your own footsteps will be making the noise of 1,000 elephants trundling over a sea of vehicles. Gunfire will sound like it is beside you and could be half the map away.You can become good at this game, but there is no point. Becoming good gives you an advantage but PUBG is so consistently against you from items not spawning, desync, players teleporting and audio issues that there are just so many RNG moments going against you, every single game and you will begin to notice it more and more.Oh, you thought we were done?  Not yet! Why don't we talk about PURB Corp constantly adding and removing features, seemingly for no reason, despite the community begging for them? Before Sanhok was released, players were able to chose which map they wanted to play on - Erangel or Miramar, well, this has essentially been removed. They bundled Erangel and Miramar in to the ""Battle Royale"" playlist and Sanhok in the ""Mini Royale"" playlist, this has a massive negative impact on the game as players will instantly leave Erangel or Miramar games, depending on which map they want to play, lowering the player count for each map and upping queue times.Microtransactions! Ah yes, the one thing PUBG Corp said they wouldn't do and have continued to pile on the lootboxes, limited time parachute skins, limited time gun skins and other such garbage instead of attempting to fix the utter mess of the game. When you play PUBG you will earn Battle Points, or BP.  BP is used to purchase in game crates... which are 99% of the time locked. To unlock the crate you must go and purchase a key, for that specific crate - this was something that never used to be in the game and more often than not crates used to be free to open.  As this essentially rules out a lot of the, very minimal, progression this game has - why do we still earn BP instead of just straight up purchasing crates or microtransactions? The Sanhok Event Pass was also released and was bugged to hell - some missions were unlocking without meeting the requirements, others were not unlocking despite actually doing the required tasks. The descriptions of each task were in complete broken English, which they have attempted to fix and still can't get right.  Think about that.  This developer can not create a coherent sentence/description for an event pass, that you need to pay real money for, so you have a very difficult time understanding what is actually being asked of you.Your game will crash.  All the time.  Several times.  A day.Do you want to use the replay system to see how that cheeky camper killed you when you were standing behind a 2 tonne metal container? TOUGH! As the game will just crash over and over and over again every time you attempt to use the replay feature.PUBG is also plagued with hackers; some hackers will hit you with a frying pan from 1km away, others will aim at the floor with a pistol and shoot you from the opposite side of a mountain, where they can't see you.  Some players are invisible, others can fly, see every play on the map and others just might take zero damage. Does looting for 15-20 minutes and fending off enemy players, before being hit with a machete from 900m away sound fun to you?Game optimization is, excuse the language, ????????????ing shocking.  It has become worse.  This game, which let me remind you, ""fully released"" in December 2017 after a period in Early Access has worse performance now than it did several months ago. You can turn off the replay and death cam features, lower your settings and update your drivers - PUBG will drop to 10fps, 15fps or maybe, if you are lucky, 30fps.PUBG and the developers are a sham, nothing gets fixed, nothing is ever commented on and the playerbase is looking for that next good Battle Royale game that is not Fortnite, and when it releases, because it will, the playerbase of this game will sink quicker than the Titanic. Don't let that distract you from the latest miniskirt you have a 0.003% chance of unlocking from this crate, if you buy a key!Do yourself a favour and avoid this game at all costs and spend your money on literally anything else.  I was holding off on writing a review for this title as I had enjoyed my time with it for a while, often checking back in to see how it had improved and to my disbelief it is constantly getting worse, in every aspect. I can't recommend this to anyone.EDIT: Literally one day after I posted this review a ""bug fix"" was released and actually broke the game more.  PUBG now has a bug where you can not use healing items; trying to use med kits, first aid, bandages, painkillers or energy drinks in your inventory or via your keybinds may not work.  In this case, you can not heal and you have just been PUBG'd once more.  Also, they just released a new lootcrate!  Mo' bugs, mo' crates, mo' problems.Review Hosted: https://theandrewangle.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-review/"

Easily one of the worst battle royale games which is saying a lot because the battle royale genre is already just a terrible lackluster genre that should have been a side mode to a base game. this ""game"" somehow lacks more content than a military shooter set in ww1/ww2, the variety is restricted to 3 maps, of course for balancing reasons the only unlockables are cosmetics and ranks, the actual incentive to play the game is mostly carved out and resold through a season pass you have to pay for every few weeks when plenty of other free to play games give you daily/weekly challenges completely free, on top of that some of the unlocks through that pass are temporary, let me make that clear TEMPORARY. so not only are you paying for your own psychological manipulation to make the grind more interesting you don't even get to keep some of the things you earn. oh and this on top of the Valve style loot crates where you have to buy both the crate and the key making things needlessly more complex and confusing for an already scummy system.the game is a buggy, unpolished mess that runs very poorly especially when compared to other games that look about the same and run fine, and what do the devs do about any of this to try and fix the issues and make the game the best it can be? absolutely nothing, actually wait they are doing something, they are trying to sue multiple people to sustain a monopoly on the genre so that you only have the one choice if you go to the battle royale genre for your daily dose of waiting in the loading screens and prematching all day long.i can go on for longer but i don't want to waste time, just stay as far away from this game and the Battle Royale genre as a whole. i've played many battle royale games to try and understand the appeal and for the most part this genre for me will stay as a thing i only turn on because my so called ""friends"" couldn't buy anything decent. I absolutely cant wait for the day that this dies off, the fact that this is popular is like watching people beg for less content in video games."

When this game came out I would grind the leaderboards all day, although at times boring, it seemed like it was worth it. Now looking back, it definitely wasn't worth it, the best way to get good stats is to camp in houses/shacks and wait for the next circle, sure you could play aggressive like Shroud, but you need to be VERY mechanically gifted to do that, and even he has his limits. The gun mechanics are very good but the movement mechanics are terrible and restrictive. The competitive scene is alive and somewhat healthy, however for the most part, the only ones who like watching the pro games are either other pros, semi-pros or upcoming pros/competitive players. Camping just isn't that entertaining for people who casually play the game for kills. OPTIMIZATION: When people say that this game is poorly optimized, that doesn't even begin to describe how terrible it is. I have a GTX 1070 and i7 6700K and run the game at 80fps on the lowest settings. This really just isn't smooth whatsoever, it feels clunky and limiting. If you have a 144hz or 240 hz monitor don't even try to higher your fps with third-party programs because unless you have an insane PC, you won't reach these FPS counts, and even if you manage to, the game will most likely look like smudges on your screen.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS' playercount is most likely going to be declining heavily within the next couple of years and unless there's a change, it just won't be able to compete with the growth of Fortnite and other upcoming BR games. Due to the restrictive movement mechanics and poor optimization along with the long, slow and empty non-action packed games, this game is not worth it."

578080,2,0,txmfoxxx,279,2,-1,147.8,"10 July, 2018","Fun with friends, but ultimately ""not there"" yet as a good/great game. Its enjoyable and fun, usually. The constant need to keep moving and collecting supplies/weapons/ammo, whilst also looking out for other players, creates a sense of urgency for you the entire round. That being said, its also totally possible to not see anyone until the end, in which case the game could almost be pegged as relaxing. The concept isn't  a bad one, obviously, as countless other games have adapted the battle royale theme since this one took off. Despite that, PUBG has somehow fallen behind its 'copycat' competitors in countless places. My biggest complaint about this game is also my biggest compliment: the gameplay. The formula is perfect, but the result is flawed. Your character doesn't turn, move, and act the way he/she would in any other game ever made. Instead, you're put into a world with what seems to be an increased amount of gravity, making everything you do seem sluggish, slow, and agonizingly painful. Whenever a gunfight breaks out between another player and myself I'm left thinking its a total gamble as to whether or not I'll hit him, despite most times having the jump on him/her. Skill plays a huge factor, obviously, but in PUBG that seems less important a lot of times than sheer luck as to whether or not you'll come out on top. Genuinely, this is, and can be, a fun game. It might take a lot of effort on your own end, and don't expect to win a round more than once every ten or twenty hours playing (unless  you're very in-tune with the game and good at it)....but otherwise? I'd wait until its on sale before buying it. I'd have friends to play it with before buying it. I'd make sure there's nothing else in my steam library I've been wanting to play...before buying it. Because a game shouldn't make the players STRUGGLE to find enjoyment within it. It should be the other way around. Decent game with friends. Still needs a LOT of work done performance-wise, and in regards to cheaters. 5/10"

578080,2,0,Nootvision,68,2,1,319.6,"10 July, 2018","Since the release of this game, it has added plenty of new weapons, 2 new maps, and a decent anti cheat system (it took a while to fix cheating problems). But this game has some flaws, such as horrible desync in matches, the ability to play on servers with high ping which makes gameplay frustrating, the item drops need to be fine tuned slightly, and the worst of all, the ""Sanhok Pass"". This was a quick cash grab for those who want more customization. It was released too early with an army of bugs and no major patches as of me posting this. There are quests that done count progress, are insanely difficult and time consuming, and worst of all, the items for ""free players"" cant be unlocked after level 16 of 30 if you bought it on day 1. The maximum progression points you can earn daily is 200 for free players and you need 400 to level up 1 time, some rewards just give you extra xp towards your level and you gain exp based on how long you survived, not the placement or kills you get. The crates system is an ok addition because about 25% of crates in this game can be unlocked without using in-game keys you need to buy with real money so I don't have a problem with it. But in the end, I enjoy playing this game with a group of randoms or friends because the strategy and planning needed for squad matches is addicting to me. The fear of an enemy always watching you is thrilling in solos and the maps are all fun to play in my personal opinion."

The game with so much potential was wantonly wasted through poor patching, lack of attention to the community, and the most ridiculous micro-trasnactions and premium passes.  I had this game ever since it was available on Steam and here are the huge red lights I had for this game that at this point, I don't even know why I am even playing this game. 1. Erangel was still riddled with bugs a few months into release. There were so many moments where I would die in the most comic ways such as blowing up cars that hit the miniscule objects such as rocks and hills, being stuck on doors, and falling off of maps proning to heal. And majority of these issues, especially vehicles ARE STILL NOT FIXED.2. It takes them almost 6 months to release a new map, and the quality of that map to this date is absolutely atrocious. Miramar generally consists of these few places Hacienda del Patron, Pecado, and San Martin. Rest don't even matter. Los Leones for anyone without a 1060 or RX 580 should prepare to have sub 60 FPS and play a slideshow. For the first few months the entire city was unplayable and even today it's barely better. The rest of the map is a complete joke. There are too sparse item distribution for the players to feel ever sufficient or prepared for combat, and the open map ensures that there will be deaths that the player has no proper counterplay. It's the definition of an unenjoyable experience. To make the matters worse they refused to add extra vehicles to the map for ages and even now it's not consistent enough.3. Korean companies such as Nexon have been notorious for micro-transactions, but Bluehole is sure fighting for that spot with their crate system. While the distribution of the percentages for earning crates is unknown, 80% of the crates I have received required a key to open. In games like Battle Royale, players always wish to have some form of progression system that distinguishes the experienced veterans to new players. Fortnite achieves this by using their Battle Pass system to grant skins to players who grind the game more than other such as the John Wick or the Max Omega. PUBG doesn't believe in the progression with their crate system and the Premium Pass. To talk about the crate systems, the possibility that one gets a good drop even on the paid crates is pitifully low, so there isn't even a gaurentee that spending money on the game will grant the player good cosmetics when in Fortnite, there is no luck involved in progression whatsoever. The Premium Pass was the nail in the coffin for the attitude of Bluehole for many players since MAJORITY OF THE COOL COSMETICS EXPIRE BY THE END OF THE PREMIUM PASS DURATION. What is the meaning of this? Compeltely disappointed at a game that could have been a major breakthrough but managed to be put six feet under due to lack of management and terrible developers."

Lag and desync is a MASSIVE let down, your targets are always 2-3 second a head of you making it impossible to get the drop on someone even with their back turned, CQB is null n void too. Hackers and Players ""teaming "" on all forms of play are a big part of this game. Pubg does show promise if they can polish the main issue, that they seem to not be bothered with at all. I would Recommend this to people if a ZA server was set it, the fanbase/ surport is big in Africa, but so far for a ZA Players its been a Salt Mine 24/7 with constant  let down. everything that can co wrong will go wrong all due to lag. things taking way to long to render in. Good example is from my side is landing in an area, with 1 other player,  Ill run threw 3 buildings looking for a weapon and the weapons still have not rendered in, while my enemy is fully gear in 30 seconds flat. Or running around a corner for cover  and still dying with one shot  2 seconds later after you closed the door you still die. Orbeing behind solid cover and the other players  driving into the wall and still killing you.  ( the hit box is HUGE for some reason.Or Getting the drop on someone taking your time to make your shots count, you get a good grouping of 3 to 5 rounds center mass. you see blood but you still die with one shot to the head after your targets does a 180 spin, ADS, leans with Q/E  ( somehow that incressses accuracy and reduces recoil for them? ) But... after you watch the death cam, from your targets point of view, I didnt let off one round at all. that is pretty much Pubg for me in 341 hours of game play.  so if you got the slightest lag, prep yourself for some pain."

It was glitchy and broken af but we all gave it a pass on that because it was just so much fun anyway. When the game released, it was still glitchy and broken af. This is when things started going down hill. Bluehole listened to absoloutely no community feedback, cared very little about what anyone actually thought, and the creator himself, Brendan Greene, started quite literally making fun of players on twitter for whining about this lack of communication, and calling players ""bad"" for dying to literal RNG. (I seriously suggest you check out his twitter to see the utter disregaurd for the community he has)      But even so, with the recent release of Sanhok, things were looking up. I enjoyed the game, it felt clean, the map was good, the guns were good, and yet even with all of their money and all the hype up Bluehole had created, it fell apart after only a few days. The servers are worse than they've ever been, the game's endless glitches are becoming more and more apparent, leaving us with an unplayable mess. This game is not competetive in any way, because the servers and the terrible bugs of the game leave every fight up to chance. Do not buy, this game has never really been good, and I think the only reason we all bought it was because we all had faith that someday it would be good. I see clearly now that this will NEVER be the case. This is a terrible game, and it always will be. If the devs haven't fixed their game with the amount of time and money we've given them, they never will.I'm over it, wishing every day for this game to finally rise to it's full potential. This game is garbage and I'm finished waiting for it to get better. Go play Islands of Nyne or something if you want a competetive BR shooter."

Fast forward 15 months... The game couldn't be in a more awful state. The game's netcode is still atrocious I still have to deal with putting a mag in a dude and he takes it like it was nothing, its awful. Also the optimization is still terrible. Erengal is alright, but still pretty bad, but the other two maps run awful for me. especially Sanhok, that map has been delayed multiple times and it still runs horribly. The amount of glitches in the game is still awful as well, glitching through walls, dying from falling out of the map, weird broken physics with cars, it doesnt even look fixed, and the game also crashes sometimes which is annoying. Oh god I can't wait to bring this upWHY DIDN'T BLUEBALLS ADD REGION LOCKING ALREADYThis whole entire community has been begging for it is since the dawn of this game, its no fun seeing some ??????????????? fly across the map and gun you down with no clip and god mode. it really turns me away from this game when I have to deal with a hacker, I waste 20 - 30 minutes in a match just for some speed hacker to run around a sonic speeds and murder me. I'm done with that garbage. Also the amount of chinese people in general in North American servers is awful enough to turn me away. I dont wanna play against laggy ???????????????s, it ruins the game and makes the net code feel even worse than it already is. Lastly I feel Blueballs knows their time is running out on this game, so instead of ""fixing"" it they're gonna add every single kind of way to make money. Hell, they even copied fortnites battlepass system which they still managed to screw up by adding timed skins for when the event ends which is horrible, and now the game is just full of advertising in your face, and it just makes me turned away, and upset at the fact that this game isn't the game it used to be.

The people of Pubg will last forever until the game is just suddenly gone, and the game that will have the lasting players is eventually the best one because the people are loyal. And with a game like fortnite people always end in buildoffs so at a sudden point they dont want to play anymore because its always the same. So in PUBG every game will change because other endcircle of the map wont have trees or buildings to hide while the other endcircle does so you never know what will happen. And if you play in a open field its just the person with the most shooting skills and behind trees its just the guy that hits the shots. And thats a big skillgap between Fortnite and PUBG. PUBG is like easy to learn hard to master, like spray patterns are hard bullet drop jesus even shroud doesnt hit allot because of the drop, i dont say Fortnite is easy but Epic Games did a bad job copy cating PUBG they didnt even make recoil on the guns. Jesus fing christ and then the point were PUBG is made on there unreal engine. Allot of games are made on unreal engine so when the price of the lawsuit is delete all your unreal engine made games are these 30 to 50 million people just gonna lose there money because a stupid lawsuit. btw just play the game that you like dont hate on other people because they just like a game just be nice to eachother and play the games you like and if you hate a game dont go hard on that people.

It was in beta, and also a new genre, so a few bugs every now and then could be excused. However it has been nearly a year, this company has generated millions of dollars, yet this game is still unbelievably broken. On top of that this is the most played game on Steam, and has a $2 million tournamnet coming up. You could argue that polishing a game isn't easy, and I would agree with you, but the fact that there have been nearly 40 updates to this game, and not one has appeared to provide any significant optimizations, is unacceptable. Issues still in this game include inaccurate hitreg, desync, OCE players having to wait up to an HOUR to get into a game, movement is so sluggish that it feels like you have input lag, the game will randomly crash, and it is so unoptimized that you need a decently powerful PC to play, despite the game looking like it is from 2010. If I could refund this game for any amount of money, I would, but I can't. But what I can do is prevent some other person's money being wasted on this pile of garbage that deserves no more than what it already has.

You'll land in a hotspot and be killed before you grab a weapon or while struggling to pick one up with the clunky UI. B. You'll land in an area by yourself and have all the loot you can dream of. Then you'll be killed by someone who drops you before you can even turn around to shoot back. (That'll be a 20 minute game of looting with 0 kills)C. You'll land in a small collection of houses with poor loot. You'll crawl in to each zone, like a some stealthy ninja, letting enemies run past you--completely unaware of your presence. You'll enter the top ten...your adrenaline will start pumping...you'll see an enemy player with his back to you and you'll know that NOW is your time to strike. You'll miss every shot with your mini-uzi and they'll turn around and headshot you in your motorcycle helmet.Eventually, you'll start getting kills as you continue playing. You learn how to control recoil and land headshots. You'll learn not to take shots if your opponent can grab cover while you're standing in the open. You'll learn that tossing a grenade at an opponent in cover is a good way to force them in to the open.Then you'll learn that PUBG has a horrible de-sync issue and that you're getting killed well after you've re-entered cover. Oh, and sometimes you'll be killed when your game bugs out and an enemy makes no footstep sounds whatsoever. But sometimes you'll play a game that runs smoothly for the most part, you'll get a good handful of kills and that'll be enough to keep you from uninstalling. Just take deep breaths and try not to punch your monitor."

The devs frequently seem to be some of the last people willing to accept there is an issue and even when they do poke their heads out and admit it nothing changes they just give a couple of verbal platitudes and move on to the next crate and cosmetic set release. Couple this with their propensity to sue any company that has anything even remotely similar to an item or concept that they claim ""is inherently PUBG related and they came up with the idea for its use"", e.g. the in game pan lawsuit, and it shows that they lack both the ethics and desire to do anything for their player base other than nickle and dime them until they lose every customer to another company that actually knows how to make, maintain, and fix a game."

578080,7,0,ZEN9TH,451,5,-1,617.6,"9 July, 2018","WHOOO, Here we go. 570 Hours into the game and here I am finally writing a review. I honestly have no clue where to start with this game so I'll just start off with the pros, as unfortunately the cons heavily outweigh them. PROS  General Concept For being one of the first of its kind PUBG's battle royale concept is a great one. For anyone who loved classic deathmatch games, the battle royale mechanics in PUBG provide an extremely enjoyable experience; Every moment is intense, multitasking is crucial, and stacking up your kills is always your primary goal. With 100 players fighting in a constantly shrinking area, the game provides intense, adrenaline fueled gameplay which can be entertaining for hours. Graphics The realistic graphics in PUBG are great and look beautiful, while also providing the player with a great sense of immersion. There is a relatively good amount of detail that again makes the game all the more immersive. Even though today the game's graphics are a bit demanding the Bluehole team has made them more compatible throughout the game's development, and continue to do so. Online PUBG is a big enough game that finding and joining a game is a quick process. The game's connectivity issues have been smoothed out overtime and as long as you have a ping under 100, online play is crisp and delay free.I wish I had more positive notes to give, but unfortunately this is where we talk about the issues with the game.  CONS  Gameplay Even though the concept of PUBG is a great one as previously mentioned, the gameplay is disappointing to say the least and does not at all live up to the greatness of the game's concept. The gameplay heavily relies on RNG (Random Number Generator) systems and thus lacks in consistency, making the game itself more based off of a player's luck as opposed to a player's skill. The game also has an astronomically large amount of bugs and glitches that can chip away heavily at gameplay experience. Pair these two major issues together and you get a game that is almost the equivalent of a rigged slot machine. Playerbase PUBG's playerbase is a bit of an iffy subject. While playing with other players in Duos and Squads can generally be a pleasant experience, there are times when you will be grouped with players who do not communicate, either because they don't intend to or because they literally can't due to language barriers. Apart from that the game still suffers from a large amount of hackers, and even though Bluehole is trying at getting rid of them they still diminish gameplay experience for many users who encounter them. Developer Incompetence I honestly don't know where to start with this one. While PUBG originally started out as a promising multiplayer battle royale game, PLAYERUNKNOWN and Bluehole have managed to pull off a complete 180 and screw up anything that made the game enjoyable in the first place.  Ever since Fortnite took the podium as the 1# battle royale game, Bluehole and PLAYERUNKNOWN have became extremely bitter towards Epic Games and every other battle royale game currently on the market. While the game started out with the developers trying to be creative and add new features while also improving the game's quality, they now spend less time improving and creating and more time trying to figure out how to make more money. Since the game's popularity has been falling they've been trying to claw their way back into the spotlight by hosting Esports events and sponsoring internet celebrities. And through all of this mess they decided to stop listening to their community, the people that actually gave them the success they currently have. As of now they see their community as drones that will freely hand over as much money as they can leech out of them. Until they get their act together and straighten out their priorities, I can't recommend buying PUBG, or any game that either PLAYERUNKNOWN or Bluehole publishes for that matter. Closing While PUBG may be a thrilling and fun game to play, I can't honestly recommend it because it simply isn't worth the money or the time. While one may get a somewhat enjoyable experience out of it, it's various flaws, inconsistencies, and developer immaturity make the game frankly, not worth investing in. Score  3/10  -ZEN9TH"

A testiment to how bad the game is: I tried to come back about 30 minutes ago because I was feeling some pubg for the first time in months, but low and behold I was greeted by the ""failed to connect to server"" screen that you get at least 5 times a session. No amount of pressing reconnect or restarting the lobby solved the issue, so I just gave up. I used to love this game (I have over 500 hours), but being unfailingly let down by the devs in virtually every promise they offered just pushed me out of the game. I really do wish the best for pubg, and I hope the devs can get their act together, but I can't recommend this game to anyone (unless your looking for a very competitive experience, that is about the only demographic this game can appeal to, but since I discovered EFT I realized that that can be found in a better game with better devs.) All in all, if you are looking for a battle royale, don't waste your money on PUBG, it'll let you down eventually.

578080,1,0,omgasteamurl,47,3,-1,453,"16 October, 2018","PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) offers users with a first and third person shooter style of gameplay with the addition of three maps all consisting of different environments and terrain with weapons and supplies scattered all throughout the area. Its ""Battle Royale"" aspect makes players do what it takes to survive and try to come out as the #1 victor by trying to eliminate the rest of the players by any means necessary. With all this being said, a game like this sounds tempting to the target audience which mostly consists of the FPS community but fails to give most players the full ""Battle-Royale"" experience. PUBG caters to everyone around the world which does not seem bad at first but when you expose a game to different parts of the world, others will sometimes take your game and turn it into their own by adding in their own hacked clients and allowing them to ruin the game for others playing legitimately since they have different regulations and rules that do not exactly prohibit them to their illegal usage. PUBG also has rampant server problems that include gun desync (basically when guns hit players with ""dummy rounds""), laggy connectivity, and poor optimization. I for one would not reccomend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy a clean and balanced ""Battle-Royale"" game and instead would look for some other title that meets today's requirements for optimal and enjoyable FPS gameplay."

Just ask anyone who has a bunch of hours how their first Solo, Duo, or Squad Chicken Dinner felt.  I bet you there heart was racing, unless they played all the way to the end of a match avoiding all fights.  This game is about survival and that often means knowing when to take the fight or avoid it!  It's fun solo but really outclasses a number of shooters when played with friends in duos, squads, or even large squads during the weekend events or custom matches.  A bunch of the negativity towards PUBG is about cosmetics, maps, or other stupid things.  It is not necessary to buy anything beyond the base game to enjoy it.  Cosmetic items obviosly help support continued development and pay for servers. If you decide to take the plunge on PUBG you do need to understand that there are things that still need fixed!   Server lag, annoying optimization issues, and hacking Chinese players are still lingering problems that can be super frustrating.  Even the best hardware out there will produce some studders and issues during close firefights and the most inopportune times.  The game can occasionally play more like Early Acess than Full Release, which is really unfortunate.  Once developer Bluehole gets these completely figured out, we should have a masterpiece in PUBG."

578080,4,0,slipknotfan,315,1,-1,134.2,"9 July, 2018","I'll chuck a quick TL;DR at the bottom.Is the game fun?Yes, in a lot of ways it can be very fun especially with mates and a good team.Why not recommend it?While the game is fun and can feel very rewarding when you finally get a chicken dinner Bluehole just does not deserve anymore money and the game does not offer anything that justifies its $30USD price tag. Even at a deep, deep sale I wouldn't recommend this game out of sheer principle.From a functionality standpoint the game is broken. I'd say the biggest changes to the core game since it became available in early access is that sometimes the frame rate is higher and we now have vaulting over walls and other objects. We still have persistent crashes, graphical glitches galore, fps stutter and invisible walls on the edges of objects despite clear line of sight to a target just to name a few things. Not to mention the large amount of hackers. I've played a lot of online shooters but I've never run into hackers moreso than when I played this game.Performance wise there is no telling when the game will be broken for you. 1 of my mates couldn't get the game to stay open for more than 10 minutes until a week later when it suddenly worked. For me I went from the general??????????????????poor performance to only booting into a lobby once every few matches. This lasted 2 weeks before being fixed.The devs are doing barely anything to actually make the game fully playable despite wanting the game to be a big part of E-sports. Whenever people ask about proper fixes being implemented to fix the games performance issues they are ignored and Bluehole will instead bring the servers down for a few hours to ""perform maintenance"" only for many people to receive the same issues they supposedly set out to fix. This is a constant occurence.From a money standpoint Bluehole has gone from gambling crates that can only be earned with in-game currency to gambling crates that need keys to be bought to be open and a battle pass that costs $10USD. The same price as Fortnite's but PUBG's only goes for a few weeks as oppose to Fortnite's roughly a few months. They are charging the same price for less content on top of their overpriced game. The game is not even close to being in a finished state and yet the greedy devs are doing their best to open up as many avenues to take money from gamers as possible. Their main focus is to make as much money as possible while putting in the least amount of effort to development. A finished and respected product is not what the devs are aiming for. They do not have any integrity as an artist.I made the mistake of buying this game early when graphical glitches and the occasional server issue was the only problem to worry about. After about a year of updates the devs have, essentially, only managed to introduce 2 maps, a few weapons, vaulting and a plethora of bugs. If I could refund this game I would. If you care about artistic integrity in videogames and don't want to support minimal development efforts and gambling in games then do not buy this product.Only buy this game if you want Bluehole to earn more money for doing nothing and you are ok with these practices in our games.TL;DRGame is broken and devs only care about money and not a finished, working product."

Not to mention Fortnite is at least free compared to this $30 mess. (Yes I know I got it as a gift but that doesn't mean you will)This games controls are sluggish and unintuitive, leading to awkward fights that usually end in whoever gets luckier. Even then, there aren't usually fights as most kills are people shooting others in the back. It also has such poor optimization, my friend with a 1080 and an overall very good setup had a lot of trouble getting 60 fps even on medium settings. I had to run the game at low settings to get a passable framerate, and I have a 1060 and a decent build.The pacing is way to slow for my liking. I understand people may disagree with me on this, but the map is way too big and the characters move way too slow. Most of my games ended up with my squad and I aimlessly looting random places and following the circle for 30 minutes (or more) until being shot in the back. There were some intense fights that got my heart pumping, but those were few and far between. Fortnite, on the other hand, has much more fun and fast paced gameplay. Within a couple games I got twice the amount of intense gameplay that I got out of all of my time in PUBG.PUBG is also a huge creative failure, as all of the ""art"" for the game involves some generic military looking person that could easily be in any other military shooter. The clothes are nothing special and the items are super boring. Most of the game is repurposed Arma assets. The refusal of the company to make new and interesting game assets leads to repeated buildings and signs everywhere which in turn makes the map look bland. The game is almost identical to all of the bootleg games it inspired. Compare this to Fortnite, which as actual named items (as in they're not called ""Painkillers"" or ""Energy Drinks"") with memorable designs as well as original characters. Whenever you hear Battle Bus, you know someone is talking about Fortnite (or a really violent bus ride), whereas a generic military plane that you jump out of is in tons of other shooters.The microtransactions are unneeded and exploitative; PUBG has all of the consumer favories, such as paid loot boxes and season passes that are well not worth thier money.If I had to say one positive thing about the game, it would be this: I find the core battle royale mechanics, specifically the closing circle, lead to interesting and tense gameplay. However, Fortnite does it better with less aimless running and driving, and for $30 less.Save your money and just play Fortnite if you want an enjoyable BR experience."

So bear in mind that I am starting this review by saying it is actually good game with good mechanics and especially fun when you get a group of friends to play with. This is where it all goes downhill. I believe the developers are now just in it for the money. I was hoping by bringing out the (paid for) Event Pass they would keep the other in-game rewards purchasable by the BP currency received from playing games, but no. The random weekly crates used to be all free and bought with BP, however even they are now split between free and locked crates you have to buy keys for. These crates should JUST be purchased with BP and no way at all affiliated with real money. It's pure greed. The BP earned in-game is useful for almost nothing at all now as I get locked crates 80% of the time I get one. The Event Pass is paid for, the exclusive skins are paid for. Not only this but the Event Pass that costs (about) ??8 also contains items that you do not even get to keep!

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,108,1,-1,70.8,"9 July, 2018","I got this game long before it's release. In fact when it released, I only played around 5 games before not touching it again. Maybe I got my fill of the game wile it was still in early access, but even so I didn't really play it that much in early access. I returned to the game when it released because I wanted to see how the game was in a (apparent) finished version.The most obvious feature to bash on is the poor optimisation. While the game was going through its development, it did feel like that was improving. I noticed less and less frame drops as the game came closer to it's official release. When it actually did release, the game actually felt like it was in a playable state in terms of optimisation. However a patch update not long after release suddenly reversed the progress made on the optimization. It's no lie when every one says ?€?you need a computer that you would have to break the bank in order to acquire in order to play this game?€?. Even so you could still experience poor performance due to no fault of your computer. The game just isn't optimised for the engine in runs on. From what I hear, since that patch that reduced the performance (some how), I hear it still lingers. So I don't know what's happening there.Gameplay wise, it's actually pretty sound. It's basic for shooters, and works well enough. But most players came to this game for the experience the premise offers. It can keep you entertained for a bit, however once you feel you've experienced it all, you're almost ready to move on to the next thing. Well at least I was.But probably the biggest turn off for me was it's reward system. Now this might be the common bash on loot boxes, however I never really liked the loot boxes even before the game was fully released and started adding paid loot boxes. The loot boxes in this game are the grindiest ones you will ever find in any video game. I almost dare you to find worse (Hold my beer). The odds are stacked so much against you 99 times out of 100, you're going to unlock the same pair of blue skinny jeans each time you open a loot box. Even though I never opened them that many times, the reason I strongly believe that was the case, was because ever time I was in the lobby before a game started, I didn't see players trying to draw attention to themselves because they wanted to show off their cool cosmetics. No I saw every one either wearing the exact same top and trousers, or just going naked. Simply because it was loads more interesting then the ""rewards"" the loot boxes gave you.There are probably more interesting items in their paid line up of lootboxes, but given loot boxes reputation, I reckon most people would avoid them. Plus the amount of reward you get for finishing a game in 1st place isn't even enough to unlock two loot boxes. adding to that, there is very little reward for doing more things then just surviving for a long time. If you kill another player, it only gives you 20 of the in game currency. Considering you need 700 in order to unlock the first lootbox (and it double with each unlock) There is no point risking killing other players and potentially getting killed yourself when you're better off just surviving. That gives you loads more in game currency, and it's easier. But as a consequence, it's also loads more boring.In that regard the game does a terrible job in encouraging the player to try and better themselves. Because the rewards for being better is next to nothing. Sure you can try and improve through personal resolve, but considering most players don't have that resolve, the game will only be able to hold onto those players who do. As a consiquence to that the player base will drop, and soon those players who do have the resolve will leave as well. Because there arn't as many players to play against. (battleborne any body? Though I'll give you battleborne happened faster and had more going against it) I've always thought (aside the optimisation) one element the game desperately needs to improve is it's reward system. But that has not changed since I first bought it.Over all I'd say in it's current state, this game is a bit more miss then hit. Many of it's early players had high hopes for this game while it was still in early access. But it seems many of the features plays have pretty much demanded be improved hasn't been improved. Laughably the mobile version plays much better, and many players who still play PUBG and getting an emulator and are playing that version because it runs better. But this game lost me before that. So I'm likely to never touch this game again. And if I do, it's probably because something happened that made every one still playing say ""look they've improved something"" (And I don't think adding new maps count). So far I've only been hearing negatives with what blue hole has been adding to the game. So we'll see on that regard."

Unfortunately I took the developers at their word, and assumed their promises of optimization, features, and content would be fulfilled.Instead, gameplay has actually degraded over time; more lag, constant desync, horrible hitreg, and game-ending bugs, all while Bluehole insults its player base by putting more time and effort into trying to milk money from us with useless events, crates, and skins. Bluehole can see the ship is sinking, and rather than plug the holes and salvage the voyage, they've decided to grab as much cash as they can before the already shrinking player base disappears completely. Shame on you Bluehole, this could have been something great. YOU could have been something great.

It was a blast to play with friends, but it had a few glitches. We knew it would, as it was still in developement. Sometimes those silly bugs would give us endless hours of entertainment, othertimes they could be infuriating. What we didn't know is that they'd take that money we gave them and instead of fixing the many bug or making the game better, they produced a mobile version of the game, and they made a console version of the game and we, the people who made this game possible, the people who gambled with our own money that this publisher would provide us finished content at some point in time. Those of us who told our friends to get this great game were shoved to the backburner and completely let down. The game is still not finished, and the publisher has instead of rewarding the people who paid them the capital to really help their game take off, has instead decided to reward us with 100s of microtransactions and a game that doesn't play better than the pre 1.0 build. They took many things that we players enjoyed out of the game, and they continously don't listen to the community. I highly suggest not buying this game, just  on the principle of not endorsing such behavior. I would also suggest that Steam introduce a cluse in there ""Greenlight"" program that states that if a developer makes a game for steam Greenlight and users pay for it. And this publisher uses these funds to instead build ports of this game instead of making the game better for those who actually paid for it, then refunds should be in order. tl;dr : This game was fun, but it isn't anymore. Not worth your time."

You used to be able to get loot crates that didn't need keys to open a lot easier but now all you ever get is duplicate items if you're lucky enough to get a non-locked loot crate. The game seems to get more buggy as time goes on. You can tell they're going after Fortnite's model after it's success but if that's what they want why don't they make the game free? That being said if you have a squad of friends PUBG can be fun. Obviously I wouldn't spend this many hours on a game if I didn't get some enjoyment out of it.

It felt like such a breath of fresh air in the multiplayer world but as time passes by you come to a realisation, this game isnt getting any better. Many of its player base gave it a chance arguing it was still in early access, but bugs and issues which were in the game from the start are still there and nothing is changing. The only thing which is changing is the amount of skins purchasable in the game, starting out light for their events its grown into literally not even being able to have access to even the most basic skins because they are overshadowed by the vast amount of loot boxes which require keys. An example of this is the in game currency you use to obtain loot crates, they used to be free to open but require more and more currency to open, but now you arent able to get any of these crates which are free to open because they are layered under locked boxes. The only change which seems to be happening is whenever you log into the game you are greeted by more and more advertisement for some way to give more money to bluehole. While the servers are a mess, frame rates are low, bugs are abundant in every map they release. Its just saddening that this game has so much potential if they would just focus more on the game rather than paid loot boxes and event passes."

I immidiatly falled in love with the Battle Royal concept, being on a plane with 99 other guys, and know that only one of us would still be standing up at the end of the game. The first time I played the game (the day of the release), I remember that I had that feeling, telling myself, ""this is huge"" .... The last time in my life I had a such great feeling was the first time I played Counter Strike (Alpha version) back in 1999, I told myself this game is special. Ok, to be honest, I may have told myself the same thing the first time I played GTA... But honnestly, I haven't played any game in my life that much I played Counter Strike, and I am quite sure that PUBG is here for a long time. What I love with PUBG is that I can run a game in solo whenever I want to play, and I don't need to rely on any third people... Random teamates use to be a mess... I love even more when I play the game in squad, with some friends, and that's what initially loved in Counter Strike, the team play.Now many people complain about this game at the eSport level being too random... I agree that that part is still a problem at a high competition level, but when it come to have fun, you will for sure enjoy this game for a long time."

I personally tried to like this game and give it a chance each time I played but unfortunately, it kept disappointing me. One thing that I hate about this game is the awful optimization. It's just terrible and unstable. A decent rig isn't gonna cut it even with the graphical settings turned down. Hit box/detection leaves a lot to be desired and I'm sure many people can agree with me and attest to that. Matchmaking lately has been slow as it takes a while before you can actually start playing the game. All in all, PUBG could have had so much potential as a good battle royale game if the devs actually gave a damn about the community and just listened instead of being greedy. To me, it just feels like it's still on early access because of so many bugs and what not that it should not be considered a ""full game"". I will however recommend the mobile port, PUBG Mobile. Although it has bots, it's hell of a lot better than this and has a fairly good community, updates that actually fix bugs and add features, as well as the mobility of the PC counterpart on your mobile device."

Eventually you have to stop allowing players to compete with other players in china/the koreas. Region LOCK must happen. If a guy with 600 ping kills me well after im wayyyy inside a building, the game is the issue. Constantly playing against guys with the name 264r5t276 or linxiaosha shouldnt be happening in solo's. Also, hackers are still a miniscule problem. Doing good work stopping them tho, and its greatly appreciated. Blizzard Ent.  has a great setup to what people can name their characters, specific guidlines on whats allowed, maybe implement something of that nature.

I almost feel like as soon as they fix one thing, they break two others. Most of the more obvious cheating has been solved, but it still occurs. The problem now is that you cant select your server and it pair you with people who are from around the globe regardless of ping. I have to go through 6-8 game to find another english speaker. Maybe when it goes on sale for $5 (which is what they sell it for in asia) it will be worth the price, but as long as the company bans accounts and not IP they only make more money from cheating so there is no incentive to stop it."

This game has such unique gunplay and the satisfaction of getting a kill in a game like this is fantastic.It's so unfortunate that this game is being completely mismanaged. This game costs $30, and I do not regret spending that money, but the game's microtransactions are horrible. No, you do not have to buy the skins, however, that's the only thing you can work towards in this game. Over half the crates that you can buy with the in-game currency cost real money to open. You can't even trade the skins anymore, which kept the CS:GO community alive for years. They introduced an event pass that costs money and gives players something to work towards, but if you don't pay money, nearly all of the rewards are temporary and the rate at which you earn XP (f you don't pay) is stupidly slow.If we ignore the MTX's, the game is still broken at a fundamental level. The game still has a rediculous number of hackers and the networking for this game is unacceptable for a game that has made over $700 million dollars and has been out of early access for 7 months. The amount of desync, especially in highly populated areas, will have you tearing out your hair after you get killed even after ducking behind a wall. For the 8th time in a row. Or, picture a shotgun battle where you land a shot at point blank range before your enemy shoots on your screen, but then you die, you realize that the game never even registered your shot. And let's not even talk about the frame drops that are still happening in close quarter fights and in urban areas (where it matters most).My recommendation is to save your money. Go preorder/buy Battlefield 5 or go play Fortnite. You'll pay $60 for BFV, but have meaningful progression, multiple game modes, and be able to play on servers that aren't a bag of potatoes. Fortnite will give you a better quality experience, and its FREE. At this rate, this game doesn't have much time left."

If you manage to get past the point of early game lag and not dying trying to pick up a gun while everyone else seems to be running seamlessly even though you have a 2000$ computer and great internet you might think you're in for a good game.... you're mistaken. after 300 hours you figure out what gun are more reliable than others (never ever under any circumstances pick up a shotgun) but guns don't make much of a difference when you have a community of hacking ?????????????????????s. If you manage not to crash during your game you are hopefully building a pretty good kit and you start feeling confident (you're wrong). although you have a 8 times AWM and can see into your enemys sole you somehow magically miss a headshot while he is standing still healing and he turns on you with a UMP from over 100 yards away. This is just a taste of the disappointment this game serves you on a daily basis. so Instead of wasting 30$ on this game go buy yourself a tack hammer from your local hardware store for $8.99 and crush you big toe with it. This will prove to be more enjoyable than this game. and hey you'll have $21.01 left over to get yourself a discusting amount of tacobell. Good day sir

I've stood by this game through??????????????????optimization, amazingly game ruining glitches, terrible desync, network lag, you name it. I upgraded my PC in order to play pubg with decent FPS. The demand on your pc is incredible due to??????????????????code that is PUBG. The thing is, when everything in this game goes right, its incredibly fun. Fantastic team game to play with friends. However, the problem is, the game rarely goes well. Theres numerous reasons as to why this is the case. When BlueBalls does do a decent patch where things are relatively stable, it doesn't take too long for them to ???????????? it up and make everything?????????????????? Other basic glitches that have been around since May of last year are still there, such as the forced down push when jumping from crate to crate. Desync is still a major thing, ranging from a minor annoyance to complete ????????????ery thats utterly game breaking at times. I may not know how game development works in detail, but for a game that made over 600 million in sales while in early access, for these issues to still exist, seems to me to be completely ridiculous. As if to spit on your face after already kicking your repeatedly while you're down,, blueballs then decides to start pushing their ?????????????????????t crate system hard. I have 37 crates that I cant open because it costs 2.50 per key to open them. Because its random, I cant even use BP to buy the free crates. What kind of utter lunacy and ?????????????????????t is this? I get a chance to get some ?????????????????? skin, that I cant even see because I only play first person mode. I recently bought rocket league, and then bought a bunch of skins. I see one I like, eh whats 2 bucks and I buy it. Why not do that, blue balls?----Positives----Can be great fun with friends.Firefights can be very intense.Getting that chicken dinner is so satisfying.Game actually looks pretty good.-----Negatives-------~DESYNC. DESYNC. DESYNC. My biggest complaint. ~Lootboxes = Cancer.~The zone is often times straight crap. If you're on the out edge when it decides to close, youre often times ????????????ed. Have fun running for 2 min to get into the zone, manage to heal, and then have it close on you again and leave you in the dust as it travels again to the corner. Then, when you finally make it in using your 8 first aid kits, someone camping the zone line will kill you.~No trading. As in, bullet trading. If your bullet is midflight and you die, your bullet does no damage. How and why is this a thing? ~The slowest rolling vehicle is a highly trained ninja assassin that will one shot you.~The recent change to helmets and headshot damage is ridiculous. A level 1 helmet is destroyed with one shot. A level 2 helmet is destroyed with 2 shots. And youre dead as well. I understand headshots hurt. They should be rewarded. But so often you die from 70% hp because someone got a lucky headshot while spraying you. This didnt seem to be an issue until about a month or two ago. All of a sudden, everyone and their moms are landing headshots. Im not sure if the hitbox changed or what. Either way, dying from 70% hp to 1 shot while you have a level 2 helmet on is ridiculous.~The audio is horrendous. Someone will be about 25 feet away from you and their footsteps sound like their about to grab your shoulder. Cant judge position for??????????????????because of it. ~After playing the new map, I cant go back to the old ones due to the low amount of loot. This is supposed to be a battle royale, yet it feels like for so much of the game all your doing is looting so you can actually heal up after a fight. The game isnt supposed to be a post apocalyptic survivor where all youre doing is scrounging for basic necessities, yet thats what it feels like far too often.~Also, make sure your pc is top of the line if you want any sort of decent of fps.In conclusion, this is a fun game if youre willing to put up with all the ?????????????????????t that BlueBalls is putting out. It is however, rather frustrating and still broken. Dont let the lack of the early access banner fool you, this is still early access quality imo. Personally, Im hoping for the Black Ops Battle Royale to put this game into its well deserved grave. Maybe then BlueBalls will manage to get its head out of its???????????????and do some major fixes instead of adding more ?????????????????????t skins we dont want or need."

578080,2,0,dantz,194,6,1,161.7,"8 July, 2018","PUBG is a very frustrating game to love. The physics and gameplay mechanics feel great, and it has a stealthy, tense quality that many other battle royale games lack. That kind of slow-paced, very intense gameplay is why I play and love PUBG.However, the developers have...strange priorities, to say the least. That the game still runs this poorly so long after its EA launch is absolutely unacceptable. The microtransactions are un-fun and useless, all the skins are boring, and the event pass is honestly insulting.But again, it offers an incredibly fun kind of BR experience that is hard to find elsewhere right now.If you do buy this game, understand a few things:1) It is very, very difficult at first2) It will likely not run great on your computer if you have anything less than an i5 6000 or Ryzen and a GTX 1060/RX 4803) You will have to put up with unpatched bugs and terrible optimization for what appears to be the life of the game.If, like me, you can accept these faults because PUBG is such a unique battle royale experience, then you will have a great time. If the realistic feel isn't as important to you, or if you have no patience for bad developer choices, there are far better BR games available."

(I have seen 2 Cheaters in 380 hours of Gameplay, thats very very low when I compare it to CSGO) I like the Event Pass, so you are killing people with weapons you normally wont  Low queue times Weapon balancing and spawn rates specially on Sanhok- cons: People complain about things that are not really a problem Wish there was a lobby with 3 Players and not 3-man Squad Game Can't queue for Erangel or Miramar onlyconclusion:  Category Rating   Graphics for a BR Game 9/10   Gameplay 10/10   Audio Quality 9/10   Audio Effects (Ghost Steps, Shots) 6/10   FUN with Friends 10/10   Price Worth the money overall I would recommend this game to everyone!"

Granted, they have to pay their dues but, this still leaves them with a large amount of money. And how they choose to spend is most damning; they bring a frivolous lawsuit against Epic Games in a thinly veiled attempt to force Fortnite out of the market and in turn take a larger share of the market, they keep implementing various ways to monetize PUBG in order to squeeze as much money as they can from the playerbase. the initial estimate of 1.5 BILLION dollars does not take into consideration the money they made from monetizing the Game.

578080,2,0,7.65612E+16,116,1,-1,693.7,"8 July, 2018","I have almost 500 hours in this game. I bought this game when it first hit early access, and was willing to put up with bugs and issues because it was an EA title. But after the game hit 1.0 and still ran like garbage and still had issues with desync, grass and terrain not rendering, and most importantly was overrun with hackers; I stopped playing for months. I came back a couple days before the event pass dropped and the game felt a lot better, they really had made some serious improvements to the gameplay and it felt smooth. It still wasn't up to the standards that I'd expect from a fully released game, but it was definitely better than it was when I stopped playing. I really had some fun the last few weeks, and even bought the event pass. While it has been annoying to have to check the Reddit to make sure the description was translated correctly, because the developers obviously use Google to translate from Korean to English. Descriptions are missing words or are so confusingly worded that you don't actually know what you're supposed to do i.e. ""Heal 200 hp 5 times in a single game"" which is actually supposed to be ""Heal 200 hp in a single game, 5 times"". But that's really not a big deal, I have had some genuine fun doing a lot of the challenges and am currently level 28. The biggest issue I have with it, is that it forces you to play badly for a lot of the challenges. Being forced to take damage, not kill other players, or when the event pass came out and you did any of the challenges that required you to be in the top 3, 5, or 10 then you had to purposely lose to get credit for the challenge. Putting the mediocre event pass aside, holy??????????????????this last update is terrible. It feels worse than it did when the game first hit Steam. The fact these developers are this inept is actually astounding. I've come to terms with the fact this game will never be perfect or even come close to living up to what it's capable of, but this is just pathetic. Every single match is flooded with Chinese players with ping so high they teleport around you and don't take damage from bullets due to desync. I have gotten behind people and ADS sprayed them in the back from 10-15 feet away, blood pouring out of them with every shot, only to have them turn around and kill me. Then on the death cam you see that only 1 or 2 of the 15 bullets that hit actually registered. I am not an amazing player by any means, but I frequently get 7 or 8 kills in a game. My point being, I know when someone should be dead, and these Chinese players are not dying like they should. Watching the death cams is just depressing at this point, and my buddies and I are just done. They were rank 18 and rank 40 last season, and they have given up as well.There are so many game breaking issues, that have been present from day one and have never been fixed. Such as: If there are too many sounds around you, then footstep noises won't register. Vehicles control like the tires are wet bars of soap and the ground is made of ice. Items take 10-15 seconds to load in when you land, and while early game lag is better, it's still not acceptable. Bushes, rocks, and trees don't always render properly at a distance, so you can be seen in the open when you are behind cover. And most importantly: Just because you see blood, doesn't mean they actually took damage. Because while this may be a fully released product, its netcode is still back in the pre-alpha stage. To sum it up, I don't recommend buying this game. The developers either do not care that the game is broken, do not have the skill to actually fix it, or both. My guess is both. Because when you've made almost a billion dollars off a game, and have millions of players who are still willing to pay $2.50 to open a ????????????ing loot box and $10 for a pass that should have been free; then why would you feel the need to fix anything? China should have been region locked over a year ago, simple as that. But the developers don't want to risk alienating that large of a demographic. But as you can see from the recent reviews, their playerbase is tired of the ?????????????????????t. To put it simply: it's an unfinished game with a $30 price tag kept alive by the Twitch community, which fortunately is starting to move over to Fortnite and other superior games."

It really seemed like a very polished KOTK, but when you have over three million unique players a day, even the best anti-cheat seems to not be enough. Virtually every match has either hackers or China based players skipping around corners killing you before they even register on your screen. Seems optimization and bug fixing patches have taken a backseat to skins and crates. Last few matches I played I was rubberbanding all over the place, but at least I have the option of wearing cool clothes while I do so.

578080,2,0,7.65612E+16,66,3,-1,76.7,"8 July, 2018","I bought this game a month after it was released in Early Access. I came from H1Z1, which I finally abandoned after so many broken promises from a developer (Daybreak) that was clearly incapable of delivering a solid product. I was excited for PUBG: the developers promised a clear roadmap with frequently published dev letters (which they did for 2 updates); no monetization until they were out of EA, plenty of content updates (again when they were out of EA), focusing on core gameplay, fixing bugs, improving performance. As I mentioned earlier, the detailed dev update letter went away after 2 updates. A few updates later and instead of focusing on performance improvements and bug fixing, resources went to add in vaulting. A month later and the first monetization scheme was added in. There were excuses given with every change and many assurances that the performance issues, rampant hackers, and innumerable bugs were going to be addressed.Well, it's July 2018 and these things have all only gotten worse. Server performance is absolutely terrible (it's great for a few days after every new update, only to degrade heavily shortly thereafter), hackers are still rampant and stay on the leaderboards for months, people from halfway around the globe can connect to local servers in your area and because of the terrible lag compensation and client side hit detection actually have an ADVANTAGE, it's pointless using in-game money to get crates because most of them require a $2.50 key to unlock and you have no way to choose which one you get, the event modes are frustratingly imbalanced and not fun, and the list goes on. Bluehole has promised every step of the way to fix the problems, but at every juncture they instead implement new ways to take your money. Instead of stable servers we have an event pass that costs $10, set up in such a way that you're almost guaranteed to have to buy level advancements at $5 each to complete all the missions, etc.Short version; this game is a dumpster fire. Like a dumpster fire it's probably fun watching from a distance, but get up close and you're going to have a bad time. This is the second battle royale game Brendan Greene has been creative director of and they both ended up the same way, which makes me think this is a feature and not a bug of his games. If you buy this game you might have fun on occasion, but the rest of the time you will be frustrated and annoyed. If you like dumping money into a black hole for a few cool skins you'll love it, but don't expect it to be anything more than what it is right now- Bluehole has made tons of money and they aren't going to change the way they do business. At this point I'm biding my time until a competent and less scummy developer comes out with a battle royale game that's similar enough I can drop this game into the dustbin of history and never look back. I think most others will do the same."

Last day we got at least 4 of the 10 time play of these hack.- Autoaim, Body/Head tracking through walls. - Using holddown-rightclick aiming always hit target at the head, even if you are 300m away and they not directly aiming at you! Takeout whole team in 5 second!So I report the cheater. Got the feedback that person is pernently ban. Ok that's good (and that make me feel cheaters is always there, too). BUT cheater always come, and more often to be seen.2. Performance IssueNo doubt overall performance is ways better now, but many still got stuttering, ping spike, desync etcAnd now we can't select a server to play. Some server ping is only 30ms, some 150ms. Oh yeah, exit to lobby tooooo often to fix the ping."

In Pube G, you might reach a wall in your learning, and find that the game is blocking you from that wall. You can't even see the wall because the game is in the way. You can't trust the replays because they don't represent even close to what actually happened. You can never be certain whether you ran the right way, fast enough, or anything because of desync. You can't even be sure that someone is hacking because of the absolute garbage way the game runs. All the feedback that the game gives you can't be trusted and that's a huge problem. Sadly, this game deserves its negative rating. I had fun with it, but that fun was always streaked through with negative experiences and honestly I wish I had never picked it up.Just in case anyone is wondering, this isn't a response to a particular patch, this is a summation of the overall experience all the way from Early Access, through the full release."

Visual improvements, cosmetic items, paid items. And yet the game remains at times unplayable. TL:DR this is a fun game which makes you work hard for a satisfying victory.

Its hard for gamers to admit that they suck at any game maybe this is the reason of this game being so overrated. It might feel very fun if you already have mastered all kinds of fps game, but if you have even simplest of trouble in such games this game will be a nightmare for you. People might argue that if you cant kill them maybe you should just hide and camp. But imagine you doing nothing but sitting in a cornor until the blue circle of death comes near to you. The real pain is that this game has no tutorials or training mode at all, you need to figure it our on your own in real game, where people in game are equipped with tons of expensive gaming kits.Maybe learning in game can be a good experience for a few, but if you have little or no idea about this game you are gonna suck, Youtube/Twitch may seem right choice for learning, but if it is the case it means that you are learning while watching not trying it yourself, which again contradicts play and learn concept.The gaming is made as complicated as possible. If you need to play this game you even need to communicate, because there almost no assist at all. This game even lacks language preferences, suppose you think of playing Squad with random teammates, you will often get people speaking language you probably dont understand. This is more common in Asia server.Even the matchmaking is not like that you will get player of your level. It feels like it just matches you with 100 random online players.

There were a lot of matches were my hands were sweating and I was thrilled like hell - barely another game gave me that so far. That's important - but also - that's it.The technics is below all expectation. Bugs in graphic, bugs in gameplay (invisible stones, just to mention), sometimes not really logical scenarios (ping, tickrate, whatever). I do know the team is working on it, but it seems they are either not very skilled or not enough. Comparing with orher games - or even with the mobile-version (from Tencent btw) - shows that there are ways to do it better. Much better.As well to mention, the cheaters! Not much to explain about it except the fact that the cheaters are connected to the stupid lootboxes you can sell for real money at steam!Here my suggestion to Bluehole: REMOVE the lootboxes completely - or at least do not allow them (or what's inside) to be sold on steam! Then you get rid of many cheaters! Instead, you make it worse by implementing more stuff like that - unbelievable.Due to that, I cannot recommend this game - as mentioned, idea and atmosphere are good and I still enjoy playing it sometimes.

I bought it when it was still originally gaining traction and before it was released as a ""full game.""Now that Bluehole has made all of it's money off of the Battle Royale phenomenon, they no longer seem to care if they make a good game or not. They only make small and easy fixes, while ignoring the terrible glitches, packet loss, and other glaring problems making the game so broken. It was not ready to release as a complete game, and it's clear they only did it to hype up the Xbox port.PUBG could have been a good game, but it honestly feels like Bluehole no longer cares, and after owning it for months, I've stopped caring too."

If you peak some one for 0.1 second and get 1 shot off, you will continue to get shot for an entire 2 seconds after you've peaked because the net code is garbage.3:) RNG, At the beginning of the game you won't get a gun. You will be running from house to house looking at bandages and weapon attachments. When you finally get a gun you want you'll realise you can't carry the ammo for it because you don't have a backpack.4:) Running. The maps are so huge that you will actually spend 10 - 25 minutes straight just holding shift + W trying to run away from the zone even if you decide to go dead center of the map. Also vehicle spawns are RNG too5:) Rubber band jumps, a less talked about bug, but when you have to make a critical jump, you have to pray to RNGesus, cause every time you are trying to make a life or death jump, the game will just teleport you 45 degrees in the wrong direction, or teleport you straight down as if you didn't jump at all.If you are looking to get away from cs go, don't come here, its bad."

Once I came back, there were these keys I had to buy. Like, actually buy, even though I already paid for the game. If I had not already played 100 hours, I would demand a refund.

This game is so broken, it is almost unplayable.I implore you to fix this game. No other game that I play has this many problems and some of them have a development, coding and marketing team of one!

Listen to your faithful players.

Bluehole doesn't have the server capacity nor the developer capacity to compete with companies like Epic when it comes to crafting a polished product. Yes, we were aware that Alpha ended in 4th quarter of 2017, and we realize that there are going to be some growing pains involved, but it gets ridiculous when loot crates and skins take precedence over bug fixing and snuffing out cheaters.

And yes, I've seen that people have complained about optimization and whatnot, but if I can run PUBG on my laptop, then everyone who has a desktop should've have a reason to complain, especially since I can't really upgrade my laptop piece-wise. The UI is a little clunky, and if it was more like the PUBG Mobile UI, then it may be more enjoyable. The combat is smooth and punishing. On one side, without headphones, you've got no chance and if you're ambushed, you'll have to locate your target quickly before you're dead. On the other hand, you gotta control the weapon and make sure your aim doesn't screw you over. When you get a kill, it's rewarding since you know YOU killed them with skill, instead of spitting as many bullets as possible ala Fortnite.

I've won the same pink/white striped shirt six times in a row now and all of the other loot crates I've earned require me to spend money to open. I find it irritating how Star Wars Battlefront 2 was being eaten alive for its business practices while this game got away scott free with something even worse, or at least worse in my opinion.

578080,0,0,toastmeister128,22,2,-1,545.6,"7 July, 2018","First of all: The idea of this game is good. The concept of this game is good. And this game would be amazing if it was not bad. But unfortunately, it is. Now, PUBG is a sort of an E-Sport game, however, it comes with several flaws. These flaws ruin the game experience so much that you actually get way too frustrated. Don't get me wrong, I am not an idiot, in CS:GO I am ranked LEM, so I am not complaining about ""cheaters"" and being too bad at the game.First of all, performance and lag. To give you an idea, I am not playing on a potato. My PC achieves around 600 points in Cinebench. But still, it is not enough for this game. And it is not a matter of refresh rate, but also technical game design. So, I achieve something around 100-120 Hz which is decent on a 144 Hz screen. However, at certain situations, the refresh rate drops down to rates as low as 30 Hz and the game becomes unplayable. That happens especially when there are enemies around. And that is quite unfortunate. The next big problem is that this game is technically made for GAME CONSOLES. So it plays VERY mushy and steering-wheel like. Do you know the swift feel of CS:GO? Forget it. PUBG sucks at giving you a decent quick gameplay. Which leads to the next big problem. LAG. This game is full of it. You want to pick up something? Click on it and wait. It does not pick up for ages. Sometimes you even click on it and nothing happens. When there are enemies around, it kills you. Literally. Also, the game does not come with a limit for latency. Which means that you might end up playing against enemies with latencies greater than 50 ms. They are unhittable. The worst thing though is that in the death camera, the aim of these enemies is virtually off always. They cannot hit you the way you see it from their perspective. The aim is 100 % off target and still, the game registers a hit. It is not a rare occasion that you on the other hand hit the enemy several times but nothing happens. In situations that require quick action, the game is dead and unplayable. It forces you to play defencively and refrain from fighting. That makes it sort of boring.Second, instead of fixing bugs and improving game performance, the developer focusses on adding more and more features to attract new players. The game is not about being a good game, they start milking it, not caring at all. It still feels and plays like Summer 2017, the performance is still horrible. There is a bug? Don't expect it to get fixed. You see a cheater? Don't expect them to get banned. One of the most annoying things in this game was the lack of map selection. In April 2018, they had finally added it - however, with the introduction of the third map, map selection was REMOVED from the game again. Seriously? The desert map sucks and nobody wants to play it! By forcing players to play a map pool instead of letting them choose the map they want to play on, the game just becomes more frustrating. By adding event modes, the developers have tried to make the game more appealing. But often, the event mode feels like a ?????????????????? DLC nobody has ever put any bit of effort into. I don't want to play a shotgun-gamemode when the shotguns are random and the enemies spawn with S12K automatic shotguns while I have an S1897 pumpgun. Sorry but that sucks. Especially when your mates immediately disappear after joining.One thing you won't find many people complaining about are the vehicles. But again, they suck. First of all, they don't come with a manual gearbox. That means that you might end up going uphill and it decides to shift up and down, up and down, up and down... you cannot decide to put it in a low gear or something like that. No. Next: The parking brake is buggy. In the vehicles that were available in the Early-Access-Version of the game, it works. In the vehicles added later, it does not. You pull the parking brake when getting out? The vehicle keeps moving. This is true especially for the trucks. I have been killed by that way too many times. In certain situations, you would want to turn off the engine or at least cost with the clutch disenganged so you can approach enemies quickly without letting them hear you. But no, it is not possible. Lifting your ""foot"" off the accelerator leaves the vehicle in gear. So it brakes and shifts down: It is slow and loud. Insanely annoying. And last but not least, there are vehicles such as the boat or the minibus that come with more than four seats. Why would they need that? I mean, you can play as a Squad but not a Quint. They minibus is a cool concept but while it has a very weak Diesel engine, it is not particularly fuel efficient. I would appreciate if it would be more fuel efficient than other vehicles. But it turns out that the fuel efficiency of all vehicles is exactly the same. That means that the faster your vehicle is, the better your fuel economy will be. And I still wonder why they have not yet added drivable lorries to the game. I would appreciate a drivable URAL-375.Let's talk about the maps. The game features three maps. The original map, the Asian map and the desert map. The desert map sucks, as I have said. The other maps feature a neat design and the gameplay would be great if the game was not so buggy. Back in 2017, I could forgive the buggy and laggy experience since it was Early Access. But as of 2018, they have not done anything about it. But they could add two more maps to the game. And new weapons. And new vehicles. Sorry, but that is unforgivable. After one year, the game idea is still amazing. But what they have done about this game is just sad. You could say that they have wasted all the potential. That is sad. Sorry, but I gonna go switch back to CS:GO. Or maybe one day, there will be a copy of PUBG that is better from a technical standpoint. If you have not yet purchased this game. Do not buy it.And I have to make edits to this review. Now, they have issued the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign. It feels like a really bad joke. The technical design of PUBG is underwhelming, it sucks. I keep falling through the map in ten per cent of the matches I play. I have to face death so many times due to bugs they are not fixing. Actually, when I die, it is most likely caused by a game bug. This game is not out of Beta yet. The game developers are abusing the players as beta testers.Great. Yet another update that changes the controls of the game. It renders it useless. Before the recent update, controlling the player whilst parachuting was fairly easy. Now there are no more 3-dimensional controls, instead of rotating the player model, moving the mouse now rotates the camera, which is a fairly useless function. In fact, it is so useless that precisely landing is virtually impossible now."

The ranking  system is bad and filled with hackers and no leveling system. Only cosmetics. And of course optimization. Everytime you open steam, there is always a 28mb every...single...day (Who knows what for). And everytime you see the update everyday, you just hoping that maybe its an actual update for the game to make it better. Even shroud, the most popular pubg streamer has gotten bored.

Like H1Z1, one of its main influencers, it's a battle royale game where you collect weapons around a set map and fight to the death with one winner left remaining. Though sounding like a pretty simple concept for designing, PUBG Corp, formerly named Bluehole, has failed to meet the mark like other, better games of its same genre. Fortnite, to give an example, is a free-to-play game that has a much more polished design than PUBG. What was PUBG Corps response you may ask? They decided it would be a better idea to threaten a lawsuit that to actual fix their own game. That doesn't even get to how poorly they've taken care of cheating.Cheaters of PUBG, congrats. You have nothing to worry about. At the time of me writing this review, the anticheat put in place doesn't consider any of you a threat. Instead, it goes after innocent players instead. Feel free to keep on cheating till PUBG Corp gets their act together. Teach them a lesson.All in all, if you want a battle royale experience that will give you a rush, I recommend a free-to-play title. Realm Royale, Fortnite, of even H1Z1 now, are all free and much better than this pile of utter garbage. Until the developers get their act together, please don't give these guys any money. For a game this long in the making, it feels like a game built off of kickstarter donations. Leave this game to rot until a rework has been created. Thank you"

Publishers depend on this small population of big spenders to keep the game monitized long after they've made thier profits on the initial sale price, and frankly, there is nothing inherently wrong with that; if people have the money and desire to purchase aesthetic upgrades, great! But when those are the ONLY improvements/updates that are prioritized, for months and months and months....well, eventually the vast majority of ""non-whale"" gamers start to realize that THEIR needs will never be prioritized and move on. I alreadly paid $30 bucks to play this. I wasn't expecting the perfect game, but I was expecting the gameplay quality to improve over time. But I can only get killed walking into a car tire, or driving a motorcycle over grass, or getting stuck between objects that you can't jump out of so many times before I start to wonder if those things will EVER be fixed.The game and the decisionmaking from the leadership is unsustainable. The business model is unsustainable. I know you have to keep making money to stay afloat. But all you've focused on for months is short term profits at the expense of long term sustainability of the game. You can't keep making short term profits off DLC if the game is dead! I believe the beast is now so large and expensive to operate that there is no solving the issue. They should have focused on tightning up the gameplay a year ago at the peak of popularity so the game could maintain its player base. But instead they focused on flashy money grabs and have lost 50% of their player base between January and June. Now they can only continue to focus on those cheap money grabs because they aren't getting the new players dropping $30 every purchase anymore and they've already lost half the base they were trying to peddle their crap to in the first place. The biggest irony is that they are hemorrhaging players and profits to free-to play-games like Fortnite, who realized early on that gameplay=fun, and that community-driven gameplay improvements have to be the priority to keep gamers engaged. Not to mention Fortnite is INSANELY profitable and yet no one seems to feel patronized by their DLC/microtransactions, proving the F2P system can work.Normally I like to keep my reviews shorter, but as many have echoed, I really wanted to love this game and felt it deserved more analysis. Keep your $30, as it will be better spent on a game that will still exist in a year's time. Personally, I'm not much for Fortnite's building mechanics, but I see a lot of future promise with another BR game called Realm Royale. Both are free, so try them before burning your money here."

578080,1,0,captainlaxy,921,7,1,460,"7 July, 2018","This is the most difficult recommend I've given.On one hand, the game has it's fair share of problems. Vehicles bug out and kill your squad, people shoot you from behind walls, textures don't load sometimes, the game is rampant with hackers, the devs have a penchant for being greedy.On the other hand, it's still so much fun, and there's no other Battle Royale experience like it, especially with friends.I've tried plenty of Battle Royale games, H1Z1, Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, Fortnite, but none of them hit the feeling PUBG gives me. The bad stuff nearly doesn't bother me as much as you'd think when it boils down to it. The game doesn't require additional purchases to play (not that I'm advocating a cosmetic-only system in a game that costs $40 already), the textures not loading and people shooting through walls happens maybe once in 20 matches for me, and you can use the buggy vehicles for some pretty dumb things.There's the feeling you get when you win as well. Maybe I just get it because I don't win a lot but it's still refreshing and exhilarating when you kill the last person, and you can ride that high for the rest of the play session with your friends.That's the other point, this game is WAY more fun with friends, especially good friends. Finding all the attachments to tweak a gun to your preference, moving through the map as a group, calling out flanks and positions, it's a nice feel to it.This game won't be for everyone. Some people can't look past the bad and it's fine. Some people are more suited for the faster playstyles of Fortnite or H1Z1 and that's fine, but for me, PUBG is great."

Puttting it mildly, there were several exploits found in their new map Sanhok, many of which were glarignly obvious locations in which you could crawl, walk or swim under rocks and into them. The QA for this game is utter garbage. The game still manages to turn my computer into an oven, and the game still has ?????????????????? lag all over the place. You still need to download GB's worth of content each time this game is updated because the multi-million dollar company is too busy devising ways to make more money off of this??????????????????than implementing some delta-updater.This game is just badly managed and there's no excuse because this is no longer some tiny indie project. Greedy people at the top finally pushed me away, the core experience is still fun, but all the bad things slowly eats away at that. It's not fun to have ?????????????????? ""premium"" items shoved in my face, it's not fun to die in the first minute of the match because you couldn't pick up the gun due to whatever ""lag"" goes on in the beginning. It's not fun to see these glaring QA mistakes that tell you the devs don't care about making a great game, only about making as much money as possible.I uninstalled, maybe one day I'll come back. But quite frankly it's becoming harder to justify the core-experience when there are other games out there doing it better, luckily for PUBG there are no serious battle-royale ARMA style shooters out there."
578080,1,0,iva10,50,4,-1,429.1,"7 July, 2018","Well, first of all, i must say, I absolutely do enjoy playing this game, and it has become better in many7 ways over time, but the monetization practices implemented by BlueHole (the developer) are ????????????ing(very) awful. When i started playing this game there were just crates Then there were keys to open some crates which can only be bought for real money, mind you. But that wasn't that bad. You could still get items from normal crates even though they were the same ?????????????????? ones every single time. At least it created the illusion of getting rewards. I took a break from playing the game for a couple of months. And returned recently.Now, let me describe its current state if you are unaware. You have event passes (aka BattlePasses from fortnite) which let you get a lot of loot by completeing challenges but can only be bought for real money. This isnt a problem for Fortnite, but the difference between PUBG and Fortnite is that Fortnite is a FREE game. (Also, Fortnite's BattlePasses CAN be earned in-game). But surely you cant make the crate system worse, right? ERRRRRR, wrong. There are now 5 locked crates (the ones you need to buy keys to open) and five unlocked. You can't choose which one to buy with the in-game currency, it's randomized and for the whole time i've been playing after my break, i haven't gotten a single unlocked one. So, to sum up. Now we have a game with an initial price which then tries to force the player to pay more in two different ways and almost completely eliminetes the ability to get in-game rewards by simply playing. I must note one more time, that the game is also evolving in a positive direction with the newest map, Sanhok, being probably the best one so far and such additions as HRTF spacial sounds, improvements to netcode and maybe even a bit of optimization.Should you buy the game now? If you dont care about getting in-game items and can rely on yourself to not spend money on useless virtual outfits, sure. But if you won't be able to ignore the existance of systems aimed at squeezing as much money as possible out of you, then maybe, you are better off considering something else."

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,93,3,1,932.8,"7 July, 2018","PubG is unlike any other game I've played.  While there are certainly some flaws and performance issues, it's so refreshing to have a game that offers a truly unique experience every time I jump into it, and it has something to offer ALL play styles.  The Battle Royale forumula is the hottest trend in gaming right now, largely because of PubG, but there is much more to this game than that.  It allows you to play solo, or with a partner, or with a squad of four, all in either first or third person mode.  This flexibility keeps the game fresh, since I can chill and relax in a solo mission with my morning coffee, taking my time to sneak up on people with silenced weapons.  Or I can jump into a duo mission with my friend and discuss coordinated tactics, and maybe even join a larger squad that simply wants to jump the hot zone, guns blazing.THE GOOD:  The graphics are amazing, pure and simple.  The two primary maps are huge, and you will play hundreds of hours and still discover interesting little areas.  The player models and textures are nice as well, and in my opinion very realistic.  The pacing of the game is nice as well.  If you are fortunate enough to win the entire Battle Royale, it is usually done in about a half hour, though it may seem like more time has passed because you will have done so many different things during that time.  THE BAD:  While many gun aficionados may appreciate the efforts gone into making guns and their actions more realistic, there is a strong learning curve for anyone new to the game.  Having played other shooters like CS:GO, which are much more simplistic, it has taken me a long time to start adjusting to severe bullet drop, firing rate, gun attachments, ammo types, etc.  New players may find that it takes several games before they get their first kill.  As of right now there is still no practice range for players to try out the guns are ""git gud"", but it is hopefully in the works.  One other ""meh"" factor is more cosmetic, and that is the player starting areas just before each match.  The lobby is a bit wonky at times, and it often doesn't remember whether you play first or third person.  And while I know that most players don't care about a ""storyline"", it would be nice to have some kind of opening cinematic or location that brings the players together just before we all pile into the plane and prepare to parachute over the map, if for no reason than to fire everyone up.  Finally, when you eventually get your first ""Chicken Dinner"" (a win), it's a bit of a let down because there is nothing except a silent piece of text on the screen that says you won.  No sound effect, celebretory trophy or crowd, or even a short cinematic.  THE UGLY:  I don't find much to complain about with this game, but there are definitely performance issues.  While certainly playable, it is much harder to succeed in this game if you don't have a top-end machine, because framerates and processing are so important in a game like this that boils down to milliseconds.  Recently, since the new Sanhok expansion, I have been having the game crash more often, at least once per session, though I expect that to clear up over time.Finally, it's worth noting that very often you may find yourself spending 15 minutes running around looting, managing your inventory, and slowly working your way toward the center of the zone, only to eventually face off with another player that you shoot cleanly in the back only to have them spin around and finish you off.  Happens to me all the time.  If you aren't prepared to have that happen often, I don't recommend the game.  BOTTOM LINE;  Because of the sandbox type of atmosphere and battle royale scenario, every jump is a unique experience.  I know of no other game like it that can make me stress about inventory and stealth, engage in intense fire fights, and suddenly make me burst into laughter when my motorcycle explodes in midair when hit by an artillery shell.  I believe it is totally worth the price, even at $30."

This list can go on but I would be wasting your time. The only pros for the game and the only thing that kept me coming back is the gunplay, it is absolutely perfect; the recoil and sounds are very accurate to real life. The SKS sounds just like my real life SKS even down to the distant crack the bullet makes at super sonic speeds. The fact that you can tell what firearm you are getting shot with without seeing it is a truly great gameplay mechanic and The bullet flight time is really well done and feels pretty realistic.  Now I am by no means great at shooters, but I am no console player. I run on a 2700x/1080ti build with a wired lan connection that runs a stable 300 down and 65 up on a bad day. My ping usually sits around 25-55 dipending on west or east coast respectively. My friends and I on a regular basis get killed behind cover (well after making it safely), shoot enemies that show blood but take no damage, shoot enemy and have no blood and no damge where the bullets just phase through them, and have gotten killed by cheaters a number of time (that number has dropped greatly since launch, I will give them that).  For me the biggest insault was taking away the ability to choose your loot box. I currently have 8 loot boxes that I am required to spend real money to open. It wouldnt be a big deal if this wasnt THE ONLY REWARD FOR PLAYING THIS GAME. The fact that this game requres you to spend real money or trade your ingame goods to actually receive your reward for spending countless hours in game put the last nail in the coffin for me. I am going to sell all my ingame loot and never look back.TL:DR The game feels like it punishes players regularly and the hitbox and desync issues are just too unforgivable.

Can't play it anymore just keep getting stuck at loading screen, I can actually hear whats happening around me but I can't SEE it. Occasionaly I do get properly connected (can't say what led to successful load) and still optimization in this game is a failure whose terribadness is surpassed only by Rust but since PUBG devs got so much money why it is so hard to pull this game out of indie level.Hence, I DO NOT recommend this game unless you've got NASA PC or something. Otherwise you risk wasting money on game:1. You won't be able to play at first place (infinite loading);2. Get lagspikes during loading new pieces of locations, skirmishes against other players.3. Play at full-potato graphics which make your eyes bleed to partially counter 1, 2 paragraphs.4. It's kinda dying considering there is a solid free alternative.P.S.: according to systemrequirementslab, my PC configuration allows me to run this at least on minimal requirements which in reality wasn't really achieved.

People from Fortnite are all trying this so you will see alot of questioning actions to what players do in this game.2) Sound is key - Sound is what keeps you alive. This isn't saying you need a $500 headset just to play the game at a good advantage, just turn up your volume, and buy a pair of headphones, they will help alot.3) You need to aim, and control your recoil - Aiming in this game is key to surviving atleast for another 15 seconds, make sure you can tell where your enemy is coming from and if you are standing in a good position.4) This game is demanding - You will have fps drops in this game, don't run it if you can't get good fps. It will be your downfall and why you'll die, don't play this on a potato.5) The game is full of bugs - You will walk through untextured buildings, cars will fly in the air at the height of the plane drop, and you will be forced to abandon a house with that ammo you need because yoou can't open the door.Overall, the game needs work. It's in full release but is still broken. Give at a go if you want to experience the battle royale genre."

It was a clunky mess of unoptimised poop but it got better. With each update came optimisation and tweeks to gameplay. However PUBG lost its charm when updates became more about tweeking it for Esports that made it unplayable and laughably bad. There's no reward for winning and no runner up prize if you come 2nd after a 30 minute game. Just a few hundren points to spend on some cosmetic loot boxes that give you the same pair of shoes over and over. Servers are trash, netcode is none exsistant and hackers are everywhere. It's so bad that now after months of being out of early access, released on Xbox One AND has a esports they're like 'ok we'll fix the game'If this were at the beginning I'd say buy it. Give it a chance because it is early access but it seems like its going places. But now it's a poor excuse for a game that hardly functions through its terrible gunplay and movement."

The only time I find myself playing, and having any fun, is with friends.Another thing that is bothering me is the store system, it really feels like its all about money now, the only way to get anything nowdays is to pay real cash, even for something as simple as a mummy costume, im paying 20 bucks for something that I can't even put on the market if I dont end up liking it. Now crates, lets talk about them, 90% of the time, I get a locked crate, and if I do get a free to open crate, its the same damn red t-shirt you gave me last time I opened a crate. Now I'd like to talk about the community itself, its VERY toxic, not Rust toxic, but its getting there. It used to be about memes in All Chat, now its about screaming in people's ears trying to??????????????????them off, or using racial slurs. The rest of the community spends its time complaining about how this game is dead, and how ""Blackout"" will finish it off, if not about Blackout, its about how their servers are awful (which is false, they're actually pretty decent), or how they have yet to fix their game (which I dont know what that even means, mainly because they havent even said what is wrong with it)I know this is a pretty petty review, and a lot of people reading this will just assume ""you suck"" which they're not wrong, im just saying its not the game it used to be, for casual players like me atleast. If you're a competetive player that doesnt mind a ""little"" bit of earrape, or microtransactions, you'll enjoy this game, other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."

Facebook's former creed of ""Move fast and break things"" seems to have been heartily embraced by the PUBG devs, with the exception of the ""move fast"" part. Anyone who's ever been involved with a software development project of any size can see all the hallmarks of a poorly-managed, poorly-tested product; you kind of get the impression that the original dev lead has quickly found themselves out of their depth, but have been kept around because they're such a ""nice person"" and no one wants to fire them.So the rapidly diminishing crowd of loyal players with 1000+ hours under their belts are drifting away, while testing teams can't understand what the problem is, as they're having a great experience playing on a server where everyone has a 10ms ping, using surgically optimised PC's.However, the market has spoken, and spoken in Mandarin. The ???????????????ing on Reddit is doomed to never reach in to the depths of PUBG Corp. where policy is set.

They were a mobile gaming company before, specializing in asset flips with microtransactions, that hit the gold mine with PUBG. Seems like after almost 2 years, and over a billion dollars in sales, that they have serious management and organizational problems, combined with almost a complete lack of proper testing, bug reporting and basic development methodologies. Because of this, they often break more than they fix. The most recent and severe being update 22, which took away the choice of picking your region, and merged the global leaderboards. It is now tough to get a match, and even if you wind up in the correct regional server after waiting, its still populated by high ping players, which absolutely affects the game in a negative way. Poor bullet registration and brutal desync, which often leads to you getting killed well behind cover, or before the opposing player even renders on your screen. They also do not have West Coast NA servers available to their players there, which is beyond stupid. Bluehole even became self aware and made the #FIXPUBG initiative, only to do almost  everything half ***ed, and overall somehow made the game less playable and fun. Good job guys! And good timing too, monumental ****ups like Update 22, when your competition is picking up steam and releasing their titles. PUBG really is an amazing game when it works, and still has potential if Bluehole does a radical management reorganization. But after a year of playing and seeing all of their ****ups, especially Update 22, find this unlikely to happen, sadly. Where the game is at with update 22, I feel genuinely embarrassed for putting as much time and money as I have into it. 1300+ hours and a few hundred dollars on skins, event passes and a few copies for gaming friends. None of the fps fans I bought copies for play it anymore either. Get your **** together Bluehole. Chasing away some of your most devoted and profitable fans here. If they actually fix the game for real, maybe some of us will come back, and they?€?ll stop hemorrhaging players + perhaps gain some new ones."

If a shot is successful from the attacker's side, the target takes a hit.

NO FUN AT ALL!Just a few that makes me feel for sh****t repeteadly.- The game is not registering hits properly either when I shoot or when I get shoot. Getting killed from other player that is not even aiming precisely me... or headshot when I was barelly visible.- The game is not responding to motions fast enough so when move/jump/pick up you feel like you move an elephant with looooooooooong animation.- The game shows different sites for players when looking each others face to face. From my view I was full in cover from his view I was outside of the cover free to shoot. I've stepped side from the way of a vechicle but it still hit me. So on.- The game's parachuting control is a joke. Many times at landing hanging up on wires, trees for many seconds and ocf getting killed because I am just hanging there unprotected till the game releases me... shooting a sitting duck.- The game unbalances hits for the advantage of better player in 1v1 fight face to face. I almost emptied my clip straight into the faced player (all hit from my view) and he killes me with only 2-3 bullets while start shooting later than me. And the worst of it when hitting target DOES NOT DIE but kills you hundred and hundres times.When I play other online shooting games (and I play many) I can reach the top no problem but in PUBG I could not even get close to it."

Two big problems I have for this game: China, and the developers. Chinese make this game almost unplayable due to their access to hacking software. I have seen a report that of the massive ban on hackers that was done, 99% were Chinese. I quit playing this game primarily because these people using ESP and tracking programs to get the sellable items in the game are abusing it too much. It is almost every match now. On the US servers half the players are Chinese on VPN/Proxy. They like to play on our servers to  take advantage of the ping being closer to Korea. I get sick of joining an apparently ""region locked"" server only to be paired with a nude Chinese bot selling the hacks over voice chat that eventually dies with the AFKs in the water. This is a serious problem and they seem to have done absolutely nothing to fix this.The developers should be ashamed of themselves. They rake in over $180 million US dollars a month from this game and I have seen little to no improvement over the year I've owned it. All they do is sell what is profitable and they give zero ????????????s about the average player... probably because the average player is a Chinese hacker and they're making too much money off these items to give a??????????????????and do something about it. PlayerUnknown needs to be kicked in his tiny nuts. The game is good. The maps are barebones as ???????????? but at least the houses are partially furnished unlike ArmA3. Would I recommend it? Yes, if there were no Chinese. The game itself should be free but for some reason it commands a $60 AAA price. The DLC was $30 and was absolutely garbage. I hope Bluehole burns to the ground to prevent it from releasing more Chinese-infested cancer into our marketplace.Don't buy this garbage. Support Fortnite or COD if you have to.

My friends lists were always lit up with people playing PUBG... not anymore. I never tried playing Fortnite but today I started playing CoD Blackout - which I bought specifically for the Battle Royale. It's very similar to PUBG but a much more enjoyable experience because it does everything its supposed to do. So far, my impression is that the game community is largely a migration of former PUBG players rather than the abusive little punks which CoD has a reputation for. I do prefer the PUBG style and find it a much more imaginable and relatable theme as opposed to the more military style of Blackout. It's far more expensive than PUBG but you kind of get the quality you pay for when comparing the two, especially when considering that I haven't been able to load a PUBG game at all recently due to poor region management. Regardless of future updates and dev reassurances, PUBG has suffered reputation damage beyond repair and it will not be able to keep pace with competitors. The best thing about PUBG?

Over time it has improved and improved and improved even more, the graphics are gorgeous to look at, the gameplay is astonishingly fast, and unlike PUBG mobile, there are no BOTS that waste your time and ammo. With bluehole punping new additions into the game as fast as they can and the community still alive, PUBG could take its place back from Fortnite in no time. But then again, there are some match making issues. And for some reason when you lower the graphics your fps decreases i dont know what category to put this bug into. Better visuals=Better FPS. So yes the game has ist pros and cons, but I would definetely recommend this game. And it will receive an excellent 8/10 from me. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments below  ;)"

The devs still have not been able to make the aiming feel actually smooth after years, nor is the netcode any good. The gunplay is unsatisfying, sounds are bad, graphics look very outdated in comparison. If you want to play a BR and actually have fun without your vehicles killing you every few games, keep far away from this game.Many broken promises from PUBG Corp have proven that they don't care about their players and are just here for the money grab. It was promised there would be no skins in early access for example.It might be a fully released game by statement of the devs (that is up to debate tbh, it's actual state is far from that) but skins were actually released in early access, with development speed still being slow. Makes you think where all the record breaking sales money went.So in conclusion: Keep away, get an actual AAA title with Blackout. Easy as that."

This game has improved tremendously but still shows need for patches/bug fixes. Past the latency issues sometimes and bugs this game is very fun and going very strong a couple years after release. I firgue that I should rate this game at a 7-8/10 because of the gameplay. The graphics on the other hand kill your computer, I can run this game on MED-HIGH on a GTX 1060, it is not optimized very well which I think the devolpers will change that soon so more consumers would come and play.

Mainly if you want to be good you have to learn how to hear people around youand how to shoot. And both require a lot of practice.The problem is, even the players that love it(like me) tend to not wantto play it anymore because of the incompetent developers and the LACK OF QUALITY NEW CONTENT.Pros:-A very realistic battle royale that has unique weapon mechanics-Runs very smooth (most of the time)-Has both 3rd person and FPS perspectives-Great weapon attachment system and great weapon mechanicsCons:-Constant desync will make you die behind cover and it can bevery frustrating.Also sometimes you will not hit people althoughyour red dot/holographic is pointing at them.-Frame drops (I dont know exactly what triggers this)-Loot not spawned when landing in a crowded area (appears after about 3-5 seconds)-War Mode is not working properly and you can't join while playing with friends(you can only join solo and switch teams in the lobby). War Mode is a joke anywayit isn't even worth mentioning. It's like when your asking something and you getan answer just so you shut the hell up.-With all the ""realism"" claims, PUBG still has no bullet penetration..... I mean of course you could count the desyncs maybe as bulletpenetration :))) sometimes they work for you sometimes for the enemy.Although I would RECOMMEND this game, the greedy developers have to receive a bad mark from me :).PUBG isn't a low budget beta game developed by a small indie company anymore, the quality of the game is sub-standard so a big NONO from me."

578080,0,0,mattster5756,99,4,-1,449.6,"12 October, 2018","I bought this game during the hype of the Battle Royal summer of 2017. It was the game to have and it was in many ways revolutionary. My squad of guys played hours upon hours and won a bunch of games and lost even more, but never truly hated the game. It was clunky, had terrible netcode, and guns were very difficult to control, and for all these reasons winning was that much more pleasurable for us; we knew we had beaten all the odds. But after so many lackluster updates to try to get the game functional, we finally had to say goodbye. The game is not taken care of and Bluehole is not a good enough studio to realize that they are killing their game by not acting time efficiently or implementing actual game fixing features. Each update holds no actual gameplay value and maps are not well created; and at this point there should be at least six maps in the 4x4 size category. I could create better maps more frequently on the FarCry 3 map editor on my PS3 and they can only release 2 new maps within the span of nearly 2 years.Vehicles are also too scarce and the bluezone is too annoying a mechanic (in this game, not others) to deal with since most of the time you'll be playing running simulator to get to the safe zone as cars are so infrequent.The gunplay is too complicated and too laggy for most to have a successful gunfight. Never in a game have I felt more unequiped even when I'm holding a fully automatic rifle in my hands.Expanded grievences: - Entering a vehicle does not default you to the drivers seat which will get you killed if you are trying to get away from a gunfight - Ability to mute specific toxic teammates was only just implemented - There are not enough real landmarks on the map to help guide teammates to enemy positions nor is there a spotting mechanic. This makes squad firefights extremely difficult to win because all you can do is say ""He's behind the tree"". I realize there's a compass, but you try triangulating the position of an enemy in 5 seconds when your buddy says 355 which is actually 230 on your compass. - Equiping gear and attachments to weapons is too clunky and unfluid. The click and drag approach could make sense if the gun slots were next to the ground slots in the tab menu, but having to equip everything manually takes so much time and oftenn in the early game you don't have that time. - Netcode is terrible, and for a month or so it seemed like they fixed it. But then they reverted back to their old system and that's when I couldn't take the incompetance anymore. - Not enough map variety and not enough real content for a $40 game (Canadian) - The constant lying and inaction from Bluehole is too much to handle nowHonestly what drove me to even write this review of PUBG is the fact that Ring of Elysium recently launched and it is far and away the version of PUBG that everyone wanted PUBG to be. Everything I mentioned above is not an issue for RoE with exception to the map grievance, which I'm sure will change. But even if it doesn't: The game is FREE.In conclusion, don't buy this now garbage game. It will bever be fixed, only marketed to be. What you see on streamers channels is rare in this game and will very seldom actually happen to you.  Save your money and come join me on Ring of Elysium where gunshots actually hit, there is no lag ever that I noticed, and you can actually kill people without the fear of cheaters or that the other person had better ping than you."

It has a great amount of tension when getting into fights, just enough to make you really get into it. The problem with the devs is that they are too money driven in getting temporary sales rather than holding a healthy player base constantly. Every update seems to have more issues than fixes and new content combined. They keep adding ar category weapons to the game, but not more viable versions of pistol and smg categories to change gameplay slightly. They don?€?t have a interesting permanent game modes like pistols only. Just events that are rushed and temporary. The flare gun should be added as an incredibly rare drop, but hasn?€?t yet. What the devs do is drop new crates to get useless items constantly to change appearance in a game that majority play in first person, they have no constant free rewards that don?€?t include BP. You want a good game to co-op in and just play occasionally, then this game is fun, but grinding it hard only burns you out if you aren?€?t playing with a close friend, and you?€?ll see cool updates maybe 3 times a year"

Poor optimization, not enough servers, insane desync, plenty of bugs and just a generall lack of polish make PUBG feel like it should have never left early access.

I can only recommend this game to those who have friends to play with all of whom are ok with the lag and unpolished nature of the game, as this is reall the only way I can see someone enjoying it.

I'm talkijng about the nickle and diming of course... I have 20x crates that I can't open without buying a key and the loot is a total joke so totally not worth it. You can unlock items via missions but they're TIMED! Meaning you can't keep it and also most of those items are lame as well (Like a brown pair of shoes type of lame).  It's just such a dumb system clearly they are putting in the lowest amount of effort to nickle and dime us. I can't believe anyone pays for these items with real money. IT'S ALL CRAP!Also, how do these servers work because I've never seen so many Chinese players? They should have a massive ping but as far as I can tell there seems to be no disadvantage and on an American server they seem to have no problem killing people at all. That's not the case in literally every other game. The net code has lot's of issues you don't notice for a while but it's pretty weak. Biggest issue STILL tons of hackersl in this game which is just a joke. I feel like the devs don't really care about giving us a good unlock experience and just want us to spend MORE money on really poor items which is the main reason I won't recommend this anymore. With all the money they've made they should be trying to keep us happy and it's pretty clear they just want more $$$ with as little effort as possible...

578080,1,0,thelumberjackgamer,120,4,-1,179.8,"11 October, 2018","I used to love this game when it first came out. Yeah it was buggy and utter sh*t compared to other multiplayer shooters of the time, but it was the first battle royal I've ever played and I was hooked. However, as the game increased in popularity, it kind of lost its edge.Don't get me wrong, many improvements have been made and the game is stunning compared to what it used to be. But the nostagia is gone. I'm by no means a great player, but usually I can hold my own in a fire fight.Not in this game though. I feel like I fight the mechanics more than actual players, struggling with loot collection, vaulting, and (worst of all) recoil. Many times, I've found myself losing fights with enemies who have the same loadout as me. Obviously this comes down to the semantics of skill, distance, fire mode, etc., but it happens so consitantly that it doesn't make the game fun. The point of game deisgn is to trick players into having fun and a sense of control, even in competitive shooters. I like that they added a training mode, and I've only spent a few minutes exploring it, but that should have been added on day one. I never felt like i was learning my weapons, since my engagements are usually short and sh*tty, and now I'm so exhausted playing this game, I don't want to take the time to learn it again.Another gripe is through basic shooting mechanics, specifically with breathing and leaning. The aspect of holding your breath is awesome and I appriciate the realism. I don't like the consiquences though of such a mechanic. Your recoil returns to normal after you run out of breath, but in reality there should be consiquences to being out of breath while trying to focus, more scope sway and what not. Make holding your breath balanced and not broken.Leaning. F*cking, c*cksucking, goddamn leaning. Your aim is the steadest when your body is balanced, not leaning at an akward angle. Its a trend I tried to pick up, but obviously can't nail it down. Leaning, like breathing, should come with rewards and risk; such as exposing less of your body, but giving you more recoile. Its so small and I hate complaining about something so small, but f*ck me sideways, you're are more accurate while leaning and thats back f*cking *sswards.In conclusion, if you like adreniline inducing games that frustrate you from basic mechanics, rather than combat, PUBG is the game for you. Otherwise, join the screaming 12 year olds and play Fortnite. At least you won't want to break your computer screen afterwards."

Ridden with bugs, updates that just destroy the game, auto server assignment that puts you in a server with 200+ ping, cheaters (even thoug I must admit this has gotten better since launch), RNG ridden mechanics, unworthy high risk high reward situations, a developer that honestly looks like it does not care about us, about the people supporting their product.The map design is alright for Erangel and Sanghkok, but on their Miramar map you pretty much see people for the first 5 minutes, then walk around aimlessly for 30 minutes just to see the last 10 players standing, the rythm on that map is straight up an insult to the players.The localization of the product is also a mess and I can??t believe that it still looks like a rushed product.

Optimization seems to get worse with each patch and server issues are still prevalent. It seems as though the company behind this game is more focused on establishing a pro-league rather than putting their efforts towards fixing the many problems that average consumers are experiencing; evident by the heavy rate of negative feedback yet still there is a pro-event happening at the time of writing this review (in which the servers crashed live on air.)I've spent a lot of time on this game and I had a lot of fun when it was still new, but even then it had its problems, we were just more forgiving back then in hopes that these issues would be fixed over time. But they weren't. It sucks to know that the overall business just doesn't care about its regular playerbase. If you're thinking about buying this game, wait for black ops 4 or battlefield 5. You will get a much more fulfilling battle-royale experience. It's not worth forking out money for a product that disappoints time and time again."

The usual walkthrough of a gunfight these day is this; Peek a corner and engage--> enemy shoots back-->unpeek and get behind cover-->get ready to peek again only to realise that youre dead, because somehow the enemy got you after youve been behind cover for 2 seconds. Desyncs have always been happening here more than in any other shooter games ive played, and theyre worse than ever.

I play a ton of solo FPP and have very few issues, rarely have to deal with desync or cheating, and have found major issues to be fixed regularly since I started playing last Summer. I still love this game to death for what it is: a survival game that is best experienced as a scenic view simulator punctuated by jump-scares and moments of sudden and intense violence. Get yourself a good headset, put yourself in FPP, and try to survive until the end. I can see someone taking this concept and making it more immersive and nuanced, but nothing else out there right now competes with this classic experience that has defined a new genre."

Well played all !I uninstalled this game for good.- Cheaters are on the rise, for every 1000 cheaters you report, you get notified of 1 gets banned. You will see people say,  in every shooter game there is cheating, but the lack of proper programming and the amount of cheaters in this game is high. Cheating is not linked to a nationality, it is a way to blame one side to direct attention from you. - Lack of ethics from developers, the circle of promoting a failed product and hyping the game by paying streamers makes you question the credability of all who is involved. At the end of the day, you earn money by any means and that what matters, right? but at the same time you lack honor which obviously has no value for you compared to money. IRL no one will respect you because of this reputation except the people with the similar mindset- Gameplay has not improved since release, the feel is the same, lags, desyncs, glitchesWhy I am writing this now, I tried to find a way to play this game and have fun, crossing my fingers that the first circle will not expire with only 30 players left because at this moment you will know cheaters are cleaning the map. I dont think that there is a battle royal game which will follow the same business model will succeed. Actually all BR games now and upcoming are stale."

But then the update 22 came... I can not describe how broken the game is, first I was playing 4 out of 5 matches with 200ping, when I did manage to enter a game in my region I was getting shot 2 seconds after I was behind cover. The Menus didn't work well, the trading system lasted working only one day before the developers remove it, If you ran over a downed player the car will go straight up in the air 100m and explode,  the bluezone visibility is a disaster, and the list continues. I can not explain how sad this is, this is literally the only game I was playing since I work all day and it was relaxing to play one or two games when I got home, but now is a total frustration every single match. They even apply a sort of hotfix yesterday and its worse, now I am lucky if I enter a server with less than 400ping, I've not been able to enter a single game in my region since the hotfix. Please Please Please fix the matchmaking, is tearing apart the playerbase, you could apply a region lock and everything will be great again.Your game is amazing, nothing can compare to the fun I have every time i get to play but PLEASE FIX WHAT YOU BROKE WITH THE 22 PATCH, NOW."

Well a few months down the road we are here, the game has fundementally broken code. Not just netcode as many note, but it appears the flawed architecture of the game is catching up to it. Wave after wave of patches and skins and other crap piled up to create what can only be described as a malignant aggregate of layered code, and this issue is made apparent with the constant resurgance of past issues. One cannot ignore the recent influx new content, but it lacks polish or really any inovations. All the while the blatent cash grab of the market continues to chug along like a damn slap in the face.

Now it is just straight desync, stuttter and just boring. Also, they messed up the blue zone by making it opaque as fffffff -- why edit something that wasn't broken? It was never broken...it was just fine but now you cannot see past the blue zone so you are at a disavantage if you are inside the circle....

FPS issues, lots of hacking, server disconnect issues, etc. I took a 6 month break from PUBG and didn't come back until about February 2018.After the beginning of 2018, the performance and other issues I saw with the game were mostly gone, and the experience became much more reliable and consistent. I began to enjoy the game much more and became a daily player. Then... about a month ago, the ""fix PUBG"" campaign, flush with marketing materials, logos, jingles, etc, began. Mind you I had no issues before this. After the ""fix"" campaign began, my recent issues began. First, FPS dropped about 15-20% on all maps just after the ""fix"" thing started. Next, I was asked to opt-in to the new anti-cheat system and I did so. Since that day I have been playing with chinese and/or other foreign players, without fail. 100% of the time. I can't remove myself from the anti-cheat system, and I may have to reinstall the game. AGAIN. The game is great fun when it works, but.... esports championships? Professional leagues? 5 year esports plans? On top of the newly introduced (for me) region and other issues?? No thanks.

I love this game alot, regardless of how much I suck (yes, I admit I'm a noob and I don't give a flying ???????????? because hey, I don't play fortnite) and rage quit. I love my squad mates that I encounter and I overall enjoy the game more than fortnite. The problem that keeps me from recommending this game, however, is the servers and the desync (And no, I'm not mentioning hackers/cheaters because from my experience, (doesn't have to be yours and never said it would be yours), most (if not all) multiplayer games out there have atleast one hacker and cheater). Anyways, these server and desync issues have just gotten way worse (Atleast on my end, doesn't have to apply to everyone. If yours is fine then that's great to hear) and the region lock solution in my opinion has been executed poorly. Would I still play the game? Tbh I probably would time to time but just giving out this review of whether or not you can handle these issues or not."

I never exploited the game or cheated in any way, i saw that Macro keys and key loggers also where forbidden so i avoided those as well. Later that afternoon i message the PUBG support team asking for more information on my false ban and if it was possible to get it reviewed so it could be lifted. the reply i got basically said that they where aware of my acount restricion and where unable to reasses the restriction and could not provide me with any more information on my ban as it is against their rules. After a couple of emails each asking the question of ""is it possible to get my $30 USD refunded back to my account as a have been falsly banned"" they avoided the question to the point where i gave up. The game itself is fun however both battleeye and the PUBG support team are useless. im giving this a thumbs down purely for this reason. Im not trying to persuade anyone to either buy or not buy the game for any reason, I just wanted to inform any potential buyers of the game or even current payers that this false banning issue is real and it is something you will need to watch out for.An update on this, have finally stopped talking with PUBG support team and they have not lifted the ban.I hope this helped you in some way or anotherHave a good day :)"

578080,4,0,tacsquid,471,12,-1,49.3,"9 October, 2018",So when you get on a team that speaks your langauge this game can be pretty fun. The downside is out of every 10 games you'll have no english speakers for about 60% of them and maybe 1-2 for 30% of them. If you're REALLY lucky you'll get a whole team that speaks your langauge 10% of the time. This is insane for a game that is so dependent on teamwork. It's possible to assemble your own team of friends but finding 4 people online who have the time to play at the same time is hard to do. That's the ENTIRE point of public match making. Literally every other game uses region locking to both reduce ping AND ensure players are likely to be able to communicate in a shared language. if I had to rate this I'd give her a 5/10. It's pretty fun when the stars align and you can play with people who speak your langauge and work as a team. That's just hardly ever. Wait for it to be $20 again and buy it then.

I have had a hell of a lot of fun playing solo, with friends and with new friends. I am yet to find a game where i get the same adrenaline rush that I get when I play this game but honestly I really couldn't be bothered recommending/inviting anyone to play anymore.Update #12 (April 2018) broke the OC servers. We had to play SEA or AS servers to be able to actually play a game. A group of 100+ Australian and New Zealand players grouped together (from discord) and tried to join a game at the same time and they just weren't able to. OC servers were ????????????ed! Sure we had the smallest playbase but if you looked at the PUBG sub reddit, we were by far the most vocal. It took 5 months for them to implement a new matchmaking system and all that did was screw over the other regions (NA players being forced to play on EU/AS/SEA servers and vise versa, etc.).It's been a long time since 1.0 has been released and there's still problems after problems. There really isn't any excuse for how many bugs/glitches/matchmaking problems there have been and how and why they're continuing!I'm probably going to keep this game installed for another couple months incase friends invite me (but also to see if it actually improves (LOL)) but anyone thinking about buying this game or reinstalling it, i would honestly suggest you keep your money/bandwidth and play something else.This game isn't made by a competent company. It was a quick cash grab that far exceeded their expectations and they just kept building on top of a broken model. It would have to built again from the ground up and be released as PUBG 2.0 but who would honestly spend any money on this company again?"

I dont understand the reason Bluehole removed the function to choose a region. This game fails to deliver any quality updates. They created an update to ""region lock"" players. However, 90% players I play with in random squads are from other countries. This wouldnt be as inconvenient if the devs add ANY WAY TO COMMUNICATE with players who dont speak  your native language. perhaphs a seprate marker to identify where you believe shots are coming from. However- that shoulnt even be needed because a game thats region locked should BELONG IN YOUR REGION. Not to mention the loot system in this game. Fornite being their main competitors have loot box based items but the game is free, this game is 30$ and should be begging players to stay not spend more. I've played many hours into this game and its draining. I feel like i can never play this game solo (due to ping being so terrible thanks for the region lock bug) as well as squads for the same reason+issue of communication each round. Currently they're ""fix PUBG"" event was a total joke. theres a new bug with buggies, one sitting in the back seat are completely immune from getting shot in the chest, the planes for awhile didnt allow players to look down, planes now dont allow you to drop the direction you are facing. Why have they not changed simple things like hand to hand combat- why wont they change the machete/scythe/pipe to at LEAST DO THE SAME DAMAGE AS THE PAN????  or at least have a seprate function?? why is the pan able to block bullets and out ""Dps"" the other melee weapons??

What was the last hope for a lot of us was the ""FixPUBG"" campaign. What we thought was a campaign to fix the game seems to be more of a marketing ploy. Now at the last day of the campaign, we're still met with no communication past ""We'll address this in the next couple of weeks"". None of my friends will touch this game anymore and I can't blame them. The last time I played, I died to hackers in multiple games before quitting. Before that, desync got the best of me. All the while you've got people in lobbys playing the same pre recorded audio messages promoting Chinese hacking websites where you can purchase hacks. I want to believe I just have terrible luck, and its all one bad coincidence. But the games speak for themselves. The netcode is horrible. The updates are almost doing more damage than good at this point.I loved PUBG and the memories it gave my friends and I. If the game ever recovers I'll be happy to play and change my review.

I love this game. I hate losing so often to people completely unaffected by smoke or flash-bang affects. Cheaters ruin me on this game almost completely. I may stop playing. It's second detracter are the glitches. I dont know how many times ive been driving along, minding my own business, when suddenly i kill myself with a vehicle while driving it. Other times it will explode from striking no object. Most importantly of all, however, are the match making processes.

So many bad UI / UX decisions in nearly every menu. Inconsistent netcode is all over the place. Hit boxes / markers are a mess... The game has a lot going for it but the bones of this game are a trash fire. They took in about 750 million dollars from the game alone... not including their piece of the market transactions and they can't get a decent Dev team to clean up the game and make it functional? Give me a break! All their decisions for this game are with pure greed in mind and not the playing community...Don't bother and spend your money on other BR style games. None of which seem to suffer from the same garbage that this game has dealt with since beta.

There has been some efforts to curb hacking and the game has had multiple updates with a couple new maps since launch. I would honestly like to say I enjoy playing the game but theres 1 problem. I can't play it....it's been broken for me for about 3 months. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it only crashes.

That's what it is, nothing more, nothing less.It can be fun, but what makes me not like it is a couple of things, just from a starting standpoint.-High Latency; the ping problem in this game is horrible. Every game i've entered, my ping was always over 100ms, never really stabilizing, my internet was absolutely fine at this time.-Unoptimization; There are times where the game decides to dip below 50 on lowest settings on my GTX 1060 and i7 6700k, and the game consistently appears choppy, making the all around experience of PUBGs nitty gritty atnosphere unejoyable to say the least.-PUBGs Difficulty; for some people, this could definitely be a plus, but in my eyes i don't see it as much as a 'fun' difficult, like CSGO, where learning it is fun and rewarding, PUBG from the get go is very hard, having you measure and calculate bullet drop based on meter distance with your map, difficult to learn gunplay. Compared to it's competitors (Fortnite, Blackout, ROE) PUBG was just very hard to pick up and get used to for me, but like i said before, this isn't exactly a negative, this is just a warning to people not into games with immense learning curves."

Better Cosmetic items   Ranking system Bots Cons: Many Bugs Many Hackers/Cheaters    Predatory IAP system Few people use Mics  PC Pros: Most People use a Mic Gets *some* content updates faster Gets more views on Twitch by farCons: Butt ugly graphics (bad aliasing/over sharpened)  Poor Performance in menus/viewing character      Sluggish movement/looting Shrinking player base Other Facts: PUBG has dipped below 1M daily players, while PUBGM has 20M+ daily players and over 350 Million total players!!Mobile has bots that scale in difficulty as you rank up, to ease people into mastering the limited controls. once you reach Conqueror, the bot numbers decrease (usually) and they act like real players. They must use machine learning or something because they are becoming sophisticated and use advanced squad tactics. They sometimes spawn behind you right after you turn around. They act like camakazies or the bomber guys in Serious Sam and rush you. I play with and against Top 100 Ranked players in PUBG Mobile every day (eSport Pros). I'll be competing soon.

It has great mechanics and while others may disagree, I feel that it is far superior to other BRs out there (CoUGHFortniteAHEM). Some of the great things is the multiple maps, vehicles, and (less) toxic players. I definitely reccomend this game to anyone wanting to give it a shot but is swayed by the ""Mostly negative"" Recent reveiws. However, there is some improvements that I think would make the game amazing. First, I think it would be awesome if more weapons were added, such as RPG's, or miniguns (With balances to them, like slow reload time and not so good accuracy [RPG], and slow reload, large mag, but low damage/accuracy- [minigun]. More cool things would be adding C4, helicopters (rare), grenade launcher attachment grips for guns (rare), thermal scopes (very rare), and other things. In conclusion, this is a great game. Period."

I have a fantastic rig that up until recently hasn't had problems playing anything. PUBG a few weeks back started lagging real bad and it persists through 9 out of 10 games now. I even got banned for 24 hours because the lag was so bad the system thought I was cheating!!! Thanks but no thanks. The game was fun but I've given enouugh of my time to a game that keeps getting worse. Save time and money kids. Play anything else.

578080,0,0,Helium_Helios,32,3,-1,57.7,"7 October, 2018","This game is a reminder to everyone of the potential that battle royale had in the early 2018. When it was on Beta, everyone lost their minds over how potent and exhilarating the game was.When it was released, the realism of the game mixed with its glitches provided surreal and decent experience.But now, after a year and a half, despite the fame and the popularity, the game never really changed. The bugs are still ever so present.This is just my opinion but I think this game doesn't know what it wants to be. It has grounded game mechanics and movements/settings, but the cosmetics are silly, and so are the events. Tonal contradiction is prominent.Even the devlopers admit the fundemental flaw of the game. And season passes for temporary cosmetics on a paid game ? PUBG please....If you like battle royale, then this is THE GAME for you. If you don't like battle royale, still give it a try, but you won't find it entertaining after couple of hours. If you are a casual gamer who wants to try battle royale, try Black Ops 4 blackout instead (they have their own flaws tho)In conclusion, its a meh."

But, the game got to the point where there was so much backlash for how bad it performs that the devs actually advertised that their game was broken (wow) and started a campaign to fix it. Since then there have been 2(?) major patches and each one has somehow made the game even worse than it was before when the entire point of them was to do the opposite. The game performs worse now than how it did 3 months after it's original release (that's when I bought it). (So this means that the game was better in EARLY ACCESS than it is 10 months after its official release.) I honestly can't fathom the level of incompetence with this dev team. They've sold probably almost 60 million copies to this point for $30 a piece and they can't put in the effort to make the game perform like a game that sold that much should. If this game performed the way it should then it would hands-down trump every other game in its field.

But the optimization is just soo bad, i remember there was a huge update for optimizing the game and i feel the different. i but this game when it was beta so i buy PUBG in very early release date on steam, so i had enough experience to this sh*t. when the first time i buy this, i had a problem that i think the others player had this problem too, yep the unrender building. but after that huge update, its gone. my pc can easily render the building. BUT ITS STILL STUTTERING LIKE WHY? i mean, i know we need a high spec PC for this, and i think my pc is strong enough to run this kinda game, but the game need MORE and MORE spec, its just way too HIGH. for this kinda game, its not even a super good graphics game, its just a multiplayer game and can u imagine multiplayer game with super high quality? i mean not all of players can do that. i can play Far Cry 5 for mid-high, AC Origins mid-high, and i think you guys can see how strong my pc can run new games with high graphics. so, the point is, i just can?€?t enjoy play PUBG, a lot of stuttering, stuck on loading screen, and the most thing i hate is i got stutter when i got HIT, its blow my mind, like how i do the gunfight if my game stutter when i got hit from enemy? like damn son. this game still need a lot of fix for optimizing, i hope.????"

Don`t do it, i`ll tell you why:1. The devs don`t care what the players want.2. The game gets more broken with every update. 3. The gameservers are running totaly crappy. 20-30 Tick servers are normal, i get an average ping of about 60-70 with an 10% package loss by download.4. Anti-cheat engine? punkbuster 15 years ago worked better.5. Don`t have friends to play the game but want to play duo or squad? Why not play with 3 random dudes, who are toxic and flame you for every mistake they do. The community is extremely toxic, at least in the EU.6. Balance? Not included. be prepare to empty half a smg magazine into somebody in close quarters before you get oneshoted by an sniperrifle. IN CLOSE COMBAT!!!7. If you enjoy running, take the money you save by not buying this game and buy a pair of running shoes, at least you won`t get shot or killed by a blue or red zone while trying to get somewhere in real life.8. You think im mad because bad? Wrong, I have thousands of hours experience in many shooters, 1200 let alone in csgo. I pubg i do an average damage of over 400 per round with an kd of over 2.0. I may say im not a total noob.9. Vehicle physics? physics in general? You may have not liked that part in school, but a game cant work without an propper physics system. in pubg you ask? Prepare to drive around, get stuck in invisble walls who decide to exist for about 1 sec because the servers are also laggy af, flip your vehicle by driving over an pixle ( if you are riding a bike better prepare for unwanted frontflips, at 20 m/h), and/or just explode.10. Remember is said the community is full of toxic players? There are also guys, who like to sit in the same bush for stright 30 minutes, just the get the last guy of guard and cheer over their one victory, with one single kill. Even if you are about to buy the game (what i wholeheartly dont recomend), play first person. Third person player sit in buildings and look with their 3rd person cam through windows and just wait to pop up and shred you. You`ll never see it comming.11. Loot. If you find some, be happy, but you are most likely to get killed by a camper beore having the chance to even use it. But there are so many games, you try to find anything (even at hotdrops), then accepting you just got something like an ump and a shotgun, you`ll run for your life because the zone is so far away, you could easily jog to africa and be there faster. Yeah you could use a vehicle, but you have to find it first, good luck with that. even if you manage to get into the zone, barely alive, healing, and just getting shot by an dude with an sks, waiting in a bush just for somebody to come across. 30 Minutes of fun!I easily could imagine of about at least 10 more points why you shouldnt buy this ""not anymore early acces""-early acces, but im sick of investing any more time into this.Buy it if you realy want, help the devs getting your money in their own pockets. Too many have done it and its allready to late to actually stop it, but why not trying. We are players, and we decide if we want to play broken games."

The battle royale gameplay is fun in general... you don't feel bad dying all the time because there's only ever one winner. When I played it, the game had numerous bugs and issues, and absolutely terrible performance. Gameplay wise, PUBG just seemed to reward camping way too much. Being aggressive and moving around a lot was pointless, as someone is going to spot you and take you out. Third-person mode makes this issue worse as people can peek around corners, through windows while being out of sight, etc. It just promotes the camping style. First-person mode fixes this, but it still felt clunky. Battle royale is fun, but I think you should try one of the other BR games, instead."

You can play the game at just about any pace you choose; once you get good you can run any weapon loadout you want and still win the game.  You will most likely have tons of fun doing back flips on motor cycles and ""accidentally"" killing your teammates as you play the game.  You may even eat good once in a while.  So why don't I recommend the game?Minor IssuesOptimization - The game still crashes fairly often on mid-high end computers.  Sometimes when your game crashes you can't reconnect, so the last 20 minutes of careful play are gone.  Sometimes you reconnect and you're somewhere you definitely weren't when your game DCed and you have no idea how you got there.  These are rare though, my game crashes about once or twice a week.  The game is significantly better optimized than it was in beta.Car Physics - I kind of hate to list this as an issue because it makes the game more fun sometimes;  but it can also randomly get you killed and completely ruin your experience.  The most common problems are running into invisible walls, randomly flying into the air because of acceleration physics, or just randomly exploding.  They normally end in laughter and not anger; but it's not intentional (I think?) and therefore should be listed as a negative.Major IssuesLag or desynchronization as the playerbase calls it - PUBG uses client side hit detection to determine whether or not a bullet lands.  Simply put this means that when you fire a gun, the bullet is generated as a moving box, and your game checks to determine if the moving box you fired collided with an enemy hit box.  If yes, it tells the server you got a hit, if no, then it's a miss.  Currently, even after a soft region lock, there is an excessive amount of lag in the game.  This creates infuriating moments where you got shot in locations that you should be completely safe.  ""Well if you got shot then you were exposed at some point"" - True, but when you combine a serious delay between what you see, and what your opponent sees, and consider that this game lends the edge to whoever takes offense, you can be dead without ever knowing you were under attack.  If you're playing against someone who has 500-1000 ping (500-1000ms delay between their game and the server, and then a delay between the server and you) this can lead to a player running through closed doors, shooting you through/around walls, grabbing weapons they can't reach, and many other issues.  Search pubg desync on youtube and you can easily find videos of people being killed in ridiculous situations because of this.Hackers - Hackers are a weird plague in pubg.  There are many people (who are probably lying) who claim to have literally never seen a hacker in pubg.  If you need proof they exist there are plenty of videos online.  They are more common in 3rd person perspective than first person; and they will ruin your day.  Most people speculate that between 1 and 5% of players on PUBG are hackers.  While that is a relatively small number, when you have 100 people in a game it means that you're almost guranteed one hacker per round.  In general my friends and I would run into one in about ten games, we get killed more by people who are lagging so bad they're teleporting than we do by people who are actually hacking; we uninstalled today after running into hackers for five games straight (third person).  The main problem with hackers is they make you feel like you're wasting your time, they ruin your enjoyment of the game.  Loot carefull, kill three squads, fight your way to the center of the map.  Then have your run abruptly end as some dude shoots your through a mountain from over 1000 meters with a crossbow.  It's unlucky once, infuriating twice, Uninstalled after 5 games in a row of dying to hackers.  Until the devs get proper proactive anti cheat I do not plan the play the game again.  Note on hackers, in TPP I see hackers in maybe 3/10 games on a bad day, they are killable and it can sometimes be rewarding.  In FPP (First person perspective) across maybe 30-50 games that I have played I saw only two people I was suspicious of, and I only reported one.  Other guy I couldn't tell if he was hacking or if he was extremely lucky and had his volume up so high his ear drums were bursting."

Constant issues with netcode, especially people on the west coast. Serious sound issues where you're unable to determine if they're coming from the left or right (no my headphones aren't on backwards).  My personal experience on the game, on a daily basis is as shown: Run around, loot, die around corner. Have Items spawn after I have landed or if I'm 100% alone watch items take up to 25 seconds to spawn. The game has progressively become more and more of a??????????????????show, I'm running nearly 300mbps down and 50mbps up, I have zero packet loss to many servers and for some reason on here I sit at a cosntant 2-4% with the frequent spikes of 7-25%. No issues with frames, besides the fact that I have a ""high-end"" system and I can dip down below 100 FPS at times on almost everything set to Very Low besides View Distance. The only reason this game is living for this long is due to how clean the gun mechanics can be and currently no other game released is able to compete. Up until another game has similar or better gunplay, better netcode, more opitimized servers and a dev team that doesn't release new skins every 2 weeks in order to feed their greedy pockets then this game will die."

Or any indicator for that matter.Extraneous bullet sounds - Good luck figuring out where shots are coming from since you'll hear the shot, the bullet flying by, and the bullet hitting things around you.  Oh, and, and only the sound of the shot itself will help you determine the flight path, since the other two sounds are not in stereo...Other annoying sound bs - Between the background sound affects, and your insanely loud foodsteps, you'll never hear an enemy coming unless you sit motionless.  So, prepare to be killed by people sitting in silent wait for you around every corner, and atop every hill.Tedious inventory management - Want to pick up some items?  Enjoy picking them up one at a time, or opening your inventory and losing all situational awareness. Forget auto-collecting or auto-equipping items that match your equipped weapon, you'll have to open your inventory and manually do it (sorry PUBG Mobile gamers, the PC version can't manage that because ???)Slow action mechanics - Want to throw a grenade?  Well first take a few moments to equip it, then prepare to throw it, then realize you're throwing it underhanded and take a moment to switch to overhanded.  Now press a separate button to cook the grenade.  Ok, now you can throw it, but you'll find that you now have a random throwable equipped in its place, and no indication of what it is unless you pause for a moment, wait for  your hand to come up, then squint at it to figure out what it is.Healing sucks - Want to heal?  Well, first learn about the 6 different types of heals, and the situations in which to use each.  Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to read about them while you spend minutes applying 20 bandages in a row.Pointless graphics - If you play on super low graphics, enemies that think they're hiding will be visible to you since the folliage won't render on your machine.  So playing on higher graphics settings hurts you.Pros:The VSS is fun, although you will lose most gun battles with it.  If it wasn't for the constantly shrinking game play area, it could be relaxing to curl up in a shack on the edge of the map and take a nap."

And if you manage to get some decent loot you probably die because of the game's META - another reason why this game is boring.Meta is to wait until someone with loot comes to you, not you hunting for loot. Which means if you want to have a decent game you basically sit and wait for players to come into the blue zone and that means atleast another 10 minutes of camping which is really boring and makes the game more like a camping simulator than a fun BR game.Also one of my main problems with this game is like I said in the beginning, all the waiting you have to do until you can even try and do something. If you die within like 2-3 minutes after landing - which will happen like 90% of the time you have to repeat all the waiting, first you search for a game which can take as long as couple of minutes and then you have to wait for players to connect AND even after that you have to wait 1 minute for the plane to start. AND then you have to wait until you reach the place where you want to land and by the time you land you already have spent 5-15 minutes without doing ANYTHING and then you just die instantly because of bad RNG. I just don't understand why they made the game such a waiting game if most of the time you die instantly after landingOnly good thing about this game is it's first person camera"

The lobby is filled with chinese music and propeganda announcements probably required by their leader.  I am starting to hate this game... and china.

So sometimes u will match up with players in ur own server but sometimes u will match players in other plant . especially ASIA server that pretty much 50 percent are cheaters, the rest are???????????????????????????who spend life time camping in corner. 4.:toxic community . racist slurs, salty screamings,trash talks,team killers,random ???????????????????????? teamates,some ??????????????? teaming players .. 5: its really enjoyable to win but u will always lose to players whos much worse than u cause this game is not only about aim .6: ????????????

578080,2,0,PyrrhoOfElis,72,2,-1,809.8,"5 October, 2018","I waited to make any review because I had some hope but this game is beyond hope now.The game seemed to be making some progress after it left early access but every patch has made the game worse. I wish they would revert back to after it released from EA and then just leave it alone. Even though it was in bad shape, it was at least playable most of the time.The audio is completely busted ever since a patch a few months ago. Sometimes the game will not give you audio queues at all (such as footsteps or car sounds), or it will but from a completely incorrect direction. A car can pull up 5 feet away on your right hand side, but the audio from the game may tell you that it's 30 feet in front of you. Footsteps are the worst, as it seems any footsteps under ~20 meters has a very high chance of not producing any sound. Sometimes the audio does work properly, and you get to enjoy an intense battle of wits and mechanical skill between yourself and the enemy. Unfortunately, this is a rare occurance.It's almost like a drug. You keep playing the game no matter how bad it is because you know eventually you will have that rush again. Eventually, every 5-10 hours of playtime, the game will work for an entire 30 seconds and you'll have the most fun you've had with any modern game. This is why so many people have hundreds or thousands of hours at this point.Hit reg is nothing new for modern shooters. Nearly every modern shooter has hit reg issues including PUBG. However, PUBG has issues with desync that I've never seen before. Bullets will just magically disappear as if your gun is firing blanks. People will kill from impossible angles. You will eventually wonder if everyone is hacking except you. Not every one is hacking, it's just this awful game not working properly.Patch 22 is the most recent patch. Along with this patch not fixing anything that the devs have said they are planning to fix, it has broken a number of things. They removed the ability to queue for 2 maps at once. Now you can either queue for only 1 map or all 3 at the same time. They have removed the ability to select your server region as well and will now automatically place you on the first available server. As you can imagine, you will be playing on servers across the world with extremely high ping. In theory, this should decrease the queue time. Before this patch, I would find games INSTANTLY during prime time and in under 30 seconds during the worst hours of the day (NA servers). After this patch, not only are queue times signifigantly longer but I am also being placed on EU and AS servers even during prime NA hours. If you try to only queue for one map, they have now placed a message over the estimated queue time that says ""Quick Join Lets You Enter Matches Faster"". Apparently people in AS and EU are having these same problems. No one wants this crap matchmaking except the hackers, and they don't care about a fake region lock because they will just use a VPN anyway.Broken features, removing features people enjoyed, adding features no one wanted, adding features no one wanted that don't even work!I've decided not to detail the rest of the things wrong with this game. I can't write that much because I have games to play. This game is has gotten so many idea perfectly right, but they were given to incompetant developers. And since every patch makes the game objectively worse and more broken, it doesn't look like it will get better. Hopefully a competent team can get the rights to produce a PUBG2 or something similar because there's just so many great ideas here that shouldn't go to waste.If you're dying to try this type of game, just download one of the many free BR clones to hold you over until better games arrive. There will be plenty of BR clones in the future, you don't need to waste your money on PUBG."

PUBG is a great game.  Heres where things fall apart.  The game had a huge amout of steam.  It was massively popular with millions of players at a time and EVERYONE was playing.  However they didn't take that success anywhere.Instead of trying their best to keep players coming back it seemed more like they were more interested in trying to get more money from their players.  My biggest issue with bluehole is their decision to allow people to buy skins off the market but not trade them.  THIS IS PURELY FOR GREADY REASONS.  When this decision was made in my humble opinion marked the day that PUBG as a game pretty much initiated its own death.  I personally purchased some items $150 worth of items off the steam marketplace a day before they permently disabled trading and was gonig to gift them to one of my friends who loved the game as a birthday present as he lives halfway across the world.   You can imagine my dissapointment to discover the next day that Bluehole without asking the community or any sort of heads up or anything permently disabled trading of all ingame items.  THIS IS TOTAL BS.  I think there are many reasons that bluehole is killing this game and running it into the dirt but mostly to me I feel like whoever is calling the shots at the company is more interested in making money then making a game.

Players are pritty much flooding out now and they use the ""we are fixing it now"" to try and stop the hemraging. Wait times have increased big time , unless some event is on. Other than a few new maps, some new menus, some new guns and adding microtransactions this has actually changed very little since i bought it in beta.I cant really recommend it, cause its pritty much what i bought when it was released just with some tacky add ons, that where really used to hide the broken game.

But now I think it's about time to abadon it because really, the creator just got a good game by chance but their competence does not merit the management of a good game. They are not capable enough to detect cheaters so now they apply a much more simple way: if anyone gets a good performance in game, he'd be regarded as cheater and banned. Two of my friends, who did never cheat in any game, just were banned for no reason and Brendan refuse any claim with an arrogant response: ""we can not be wrong.""I'm sure that they've earned enough from this game, but now I won't play it anymore because really their attitude is unacceptable and now none of my friends plays it now."

I got 1st 6 times and yes that was satisfying, but that satisfaction didn't last long, because al the games after and before I only felt frustration. Battle Royals aren't fun in my opinion. You scafice around for 15 minutes and not seeing any good lood and after that you get shot from behind when you can't do anything. But when you do see someone from upfront you have to pray that he doesn't have better lood than you and that he doesn't rubber band or that the hit registration doens't suck.  99% of all games where pure frustration. Other Battle Royals like Fortnite are the same. BUT that game has a lot of fun game modes, fun game mechanics and the hit registration is good.  This game always felt clunky to me.

Cheaters are a problem still and I see no indication of that changing anytime soon. Performance issues still propping up after nearly a year in full release. Desync is a MAJOR issue and while the devs are aware of it they don't seem to be fixing it yet. I like the content releases it continues to flesh out the game but the fact that content is coming faster than stabilization and bug fixing is frustrating if not alarming. My biggest complaint is the way they handle testing. Testing major content and gameplay changes for as little as two days before release while 2-5000 people are playing it is hardly a useful test. That stuff comes to full release and for a time the quality of the game suffers because they are pushing under tested stuff quicker than fixes can come. I have hope that the game will be olished and complete eventually but it isn't yet. In my eyes it doesn't deserve to be out of EA yet despite being a pretty great game. Again, I love this game.

Tonight i have been all around the world playing with hardly any english speaking players. When is PUB Corp going to bite the bullet and just lock out chinese players form playing on EU and US servers. As for the new anti cheat ,,, what a joke !! First 3 games today and aimbots and wallhacks are still plentyfull. (i know they where aimbots as they tried to shoot me through rocks and walls also one player was just popping shot round everycorner and you could see in the replay he was shooting where the outline or box was) One team tonight, a bunch of very friendly chinese players landed with me and started to spawn equipment including a ghillie suit and a Shade jacket. When i question what was going on they team killed me. To be honest i think this although brilliant when its fair and level is ????????????ed. The cheats are one step ahead all the time wich makes the game unplayable as you will reach top ten only by avoiding the aimbots and wh. I love this game dont get me wrong but allowing a player base that does not hold with western idelals of fair paly but rather lives by a win by any means ethios to interact with a player base that doesnt is just stupid. I understand as the company is eastern based they want to promote the interaction between regions but its not workiong and they are driving away players daily. Look xbox did away with allowing eastern players to play against western players for the same reason many yeasr ago and it stoppped 90% of the cheating. (lost planet was the last time i think you could compete directly againt china/japan and thery hacked to??????????????????!!) i may be comming across badly here but im just saying what most people are thinking. This game will continue to fail aslong the developers stop being held to ransom by thier Chinese overlords. I mean BO4 is coming and its will seriously bury PUBG if these problems are not sorted. Graphically its amazing, gameplay amzing, meeting people from around the world is brilliant but the cheating is just terrible. Its worth taking the graphical and FPS reduction by playing on console just to have a game where your not waiting to be killed by an irion sight perfect head shot through a cluster of trees form half a mile away. On the plus side i did get a message from PUBG today to tell me that a player had been banned from my report.

You are entirely entitled to your own opinion and suggestions are always welcome.First off I must say that these types of games live and die by their community, YOU CANNOT HAVE A WORKING BATTLE ROYALE IF YOU CAN'T KEEP THE PLAYERS ENTERTAINED. As with the situation currently with the OCE servers have little or no players in them, i recommend a buyers beware for people that are planning to buy and play this game if you are in Australia or New Zealand. That being said, i came back to this game after a few months to see how it was doing and what the fuss was about topping the steam stats for quite a while now. Turns out my expectations of vast improvement and major change have turned into a massive dissapointment. First off let me say that i'm not a big fan of the battle royale genre (as most of my games mostly centre around competitive fps and the like) however through my experience of what was left of this game on OCE servers (don't really want to go to another server to experience 300+ ping) was a trainwreck of a game with very little change that i could notice from the early access version. With the long que times of up to 10 minutes long to get a single game with 4 - 10 players into it.The changes i noticed:- more guns (yay i guess)- sound improvement? (stills sounds terrible)- climbing seems smoother- A ""testing island"" (not single player though)- Better main menu screen? (now infested with buy menus for cosmetic items)- New maps? (too bad i can't stand the 10 min que timers)Despite changes to the game i still find it quite buggy:- vehicles will sometime phase through bridges and explode- vehicles will sometimes fly... and explode- character will do some weird glitches in the terrainAnd now the section where i would rant but no one will probably be bothered reading entire paragraphs so here are some dot points:- more loot boxes that require keys to open!- DID I MENTION NO ONE PLAYS THIS ON OCE ANYMORE?- Sound is still garbage- Fix PUBG seems like a joke (even Operation Health for seige was even more proffesional than this)- Still a glitchy mess- Focus on the cosmetics rather than the gameplay i see?- Servers still kinda laggyin summary i cannot recommend this game currently in this state for players in OCE. A major buyers beware, if you want a good battle royale experience, this is not the game you are looking for."

First of all this game had a rocky start, some will say thats to be expected from early access, but they took longer than usual and the devs priorities have been pretty wacky from release till now conistently. The past 3 to 4 months playing on Oceania server was very noticeably very low priority on playerunknowns budget, many gamers had left to the latest and greatest games naturally but there was still a populous community here however they didn't adjust the server and so only squad third person became available to play as wait times became inappropriate for the other modes. Many more players left making it harder to find a game in these few (one!) gamemodes, it was pretty much only available at this point at a specific part of day, when people finish their work in late arvo Aus/NZ time. South East Asia was the only other option at this time which isn't actually an option when your ping ranges from 240-300ms and nearly everybody else has a huge advantage. At some point it became hard to even find a game in the late arvo so even more players left and thats when Playerunknown decided to be decent and push to fix Oceania server. It has been a few weeks in downtime and now that it is up I am still rather dissapointed. Not because the server isn't fixed, but the time they wasted while NOT fixing this issue has caused far too many players to leave and move on from this game probably never to come back regularly. I'll enjoy the time this game has left in Oceania, but for anybody looking to buy this game.. well you've read my review, too little too late Playerunknown."

I started playing while it was in game preview and now that it's out, it feels and looks the same. Aiming seems non-existant, damge registry has been out of whack for as long as I've played and other members on my squad seem to be the main reason I die. I gave up on squads for that and a number of other reason and found myself running into even more problems after that. I shot another player point blank in the head several times and I'm guessing the ballcaps are bulletproof because it did nothing. Shot in the foot with a shotgun though? Dead. Also, what's with the loot crates? I spent my BP to buy four loot crates and two of them had the same pair of loafers in the them. Nobody survives a battle royal wearing loafers. I also recieved one after being offline for a while and had to pay $2 to open it. It was a blue t-shirt.

If that upset you back then, pubg will put your frustration to a level, you can't imagine. If you get angry quickly, perhaps even inappropriately, and get into conflict with your environment, you should definitely ignore this game. In 2018, pubg corporation catapults you into 1999 with their netcode. Your i7 and fiber port will feel like an i486 and a dial-up modem. -""..but i have a GTX1080!"" you might say-PUBG dont care.Pubg corp. wrote DSYNC on their chest. That's their thing. Honestly.Pubg makes rage great again. And believe me, dsync will bring you rage...And the updates. I don't know how they pass the quality control. Integration tests are obviously not done. Every update breaks two things which worked before. Dont get me wrong, i like the game concept, the idea, but the implementation is an insult to the term ""release"". I can also overlook the cheaters, but the real reason for my negative judgement is the mentality of the developers. Their focus is obviously on monetising the s*** out of the game idea instead of offering a good gaming experience. The ratio no longer fits.

We've been playing on Russian region, because that's where we live.

Well, it just don't start at all. When I press ""Ready"", I can see that I have the checkmark on my nickname in the game, he doesn't, and vise versa. Tried starting different game mods and squad options - still nothing. Sometimes there appears to be a disconnect icon on mine or his nickname (we are still talking about lobby, because we haven't managed to beat it yet).So after all this we tried to start a solo game by ourselves. Guess what? I've been places on EU server, and he's been placed on Asian server (where he have 250ms ping, yeah).There is also a matter of Russain servers, because that's a ???????????????how by itself. They aren't owned or at least operated by Bluehole. They are owned by Russain company ""Mail.ru"", and my guess is - Bluehole can't or just forgot to include them into their brand new region autoselect feature.They promised that the region will be autopicked for the best suited for your party, guess they lied.

Period.- Strategic and methodical mid-late game, fast paced and crazy early game.Cons:- Horrible Desync all the time (Around corner and you die)- Sound has come a long way, but is still pretty bad. (Especially footsteps)- Movement feels horrible and clunky. The movement in this game is really bad and feels awful to play. Not fluid at all.- LOTS of hackers.- Cosntant server issues (can't connect to play even with Gigabyte internet connection 1/gbps)- Horribly optimized. I have a GTX 1080 and i7-6700k and I get frame drops below 90 at minimum graphics consistantly.

I'm not going to gamble my money on cosmetics, release them in packs if you want more shekels out of me. Community is a bunch of tryhard whiners apparently, but there are cool and funny people out there.  Final thoughts:  This game is worth the thirty bucks, as you can see from the play time people sink into it.  Very replayable, especially with friends.  It's okay if you're garbage (like me), PUBG matches you with people of similar rank.  That doesn't mean it will be easy, you just won't be playing against people who can drop you from a mile out right away.  The gunplay is so tight, I love scavenging and kitting out my weapons.  I'm definitely putting a few hundred more hours in."

There are also changes in the content of the game, the original version of Thomson and 98K belong to the airdrop, now the game content is greatly changed, so that some old players have to re-familiar with the rules of the game. Now pubg is panicked when it sees a huge drop in the number of players and comes up with an old version of the model (I forgot the name) that wants to save the old players. Then there's the plug-in problem, and now the game is full of plug-ins: acceleration, locks, perspective, self-aiming, through the wall...! Surprisingly, the game hall all kinds of publicity plug-in, pubg has no ability to manage, so indulge, and those publicity plug-in, will not get off the plane (reason I think). Finally is the issue of mis-sealing, teammates hang up, they also have to be implicated, teammates fly hanging, you will be blocked, teammates open materials show hanging, you will be blocked! Even if you use a grenade to kill several people, the system will judge you to be a plug-in!I hope that pubg can collect the suggestions of the majority of players, do not blindly pursue the interests, when the players are satisfied, the interests naturally exist, the players are not satisfied, you are likely to have no money."

When i say ""obvious"" i mean:-watching us run inside a building without a clear line of sight. -Aim snapping to our heads instantly and unnaturally-Bullets hitting nothing but our head without clear line of sight while at full auto. -3rd person spray over a hill hitting only a single spot on the other side - where our heads are- until mounting the hill and killing us.This game is completely riddled with hackers.

You have to have the highest potential to let people down so badly, and this game still does. It has amazing weapon balance and fundamental aim mechanics, with a pacing that keeps you coming back again and again (on Sanhok that is). But the biggest disappointment will always be something which could have been the best in principle but just does not pull it off. I always try to be the first to blame myself for dying (after a rage or two), but after going on a great run, entering a new game and then dying because you don't hear an enemy parachute land near, Alt+F4 is sometimes all a competitive person can do to stay sane. The most entertaining part of this game has become that the devs can do more things wrong than they can right. Even after the recent problems with region lock, they gave away free BP and items... which I received twice. Every bug resolution creates 3 more it seems.All problems aside, the reason the devs deserve hard criticism and mockery in reality is that they have pushed in game purchases on people and hosted esports tournies before truly investing in fixing their game or providing new content. They could re-write their whole game on a different engine if they wanted to with the money they've made, but don't want to take the hit. We could have 5 or 6 maps with varied loot, but instead we have Halloween skin purchases. We could be rewarded for all the hours we've spent with decent, free weapon skins, but all I can seem to unlock without paying more money is the Beige lot. Don't buy this game unless you are content with being disregarded and losing to random chance in a title that is aimed at being a simulator. Let's hope EA and Battlefield can do something amazing with their Frostbite engine."
578080,1,0,technobolt,36,1,-1,18.6,"28 October, 2018","This game could have been unstoppable, but the devs, whether or not they are underqualified to manage the scale of the game, have simply underperformed.The game does not listen to its community, it implements unwanted changes for no reason and has THE WORST MATCHMAKING I have ever seen in this game.The first game I have ever cracked 1000 hours in and I feel like the last 400 were trying to wait for a game in OCE.If you live in Australia or NZ, wait until they fix ping-based matchmaking, it is hands down the worst implementation of a system in a game period. 6+ months of being unable to play on local servers, gets fixed for 2 weeks, but in classic BlueHole fashion the miff it up and break other servers. So what do they do? Implement another 'fix' that once again breaks the servers for OCE and apparently South America. To repeat, this game could be amazing, I truly do believe it still will be, but if they don't give their ENTIRE playerbase attention, not just China and NA, it will crumble more than it already has.If you are from OCE don't buy this game in its current state.5/10 IGN"

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,57,5,1,464.8,"30 September, 2018","Okay, first off, the bloke in the red tshirt in the beginning of the trailer raises his hand above his eyes to block out the sun. This is false advertising to such an extreme. So bad, that I actually thought it was a real emote, the first time I saw it. It made me pause the video, lean my face into the screen, and squint at the guy walking with no guns and blocking the sun while what appears to be his team, rush past him and desert him. I've clocked 440+ hours on this game so you'd think that I would've done a ""sun blocking"" emote before.Righto, the review. Okay, I got this...FIX THE TWATTY??????????????????SERVERS.I'm standing behind a wall, I peak out, see a guy with a kar98k, okay, he's there. So I tilt my head back behind the wall, then my head gets shot off by him. At this point I have 2 options. I either watch my deathcam and throw my headset against my window, or go to make a cuppa, come back, and start a new game. I do the second one, since I feel unusually calm and want to spare a window. THE SERVERS:Since I live in Oceana the servers have always been a problem for me. I could wait 6 minutes for a game with decent ping and 80 players, or instant join a full NA game with twatty??????????????????ping. However, recently, It's like a bomb has been dropped in Oceana and I have been using noise-cancelling headphones, not noticing that everyone has actually been killed. I hate to say it, I really do, because I love this game, always have, but DO NOT buy this game if you live in oceana. Our ping is the equivelant of a snail traveling on soul sand.GRAPHICS:Not much to be said really. If you can handle max/good graphics then lucky you, your in the top 13% of people that buy high end PCs. But for the rest of us, living in the filth with 1050ti's and such, we get around 60fps. Make that 40 since windows wants to update.GAMEPLAY:PUBG's gameplay has always intrigued me. I came from a background of CSGO so am found of military shooters that rely on smart decsions. I love the way you can suprise people and use different guns to a tactical advantage. However, there is always something that manages to creep under my skin. Like people that shut doors after they leave a building. Except, this is much more personal, more rage-enducing, more headset-slammable. The camper. The person that comes out on top because they went to get dinner and left their game on, with a Micro-Uzi in hand and a zone that grants their favor. They would've picked up a Scar due to owning the ""Year 1"" skin, but they decided they liked the Micro-Uzi better. They also picked up a??????????????????ton of ACP ammo. (Just in case).Put short, the gameplay is slow. If you are commited enough to play a 40minute match, maybe land, see noone then eventually get shot in the face, then go for it. Its a great game with strategic possibilites. And I do love it. CONCLUSION:However, it is 40dollars, I recommend watching some gameplay before you buy it. And not buying it at all if you live in oceana and have survived the fallout."

No other game out there can come close to replicating the feel you get when you're among the last 10 alive or when you're driving through the red zone with all your squad mates. It's a really fun game and at 30 dollars I think it's very fairly priced. Although there are some occasional glitches and bugs the developers have not only been slowly but surely fixing pubg over time, they've been adding real features that have improved the game siginificantly.

Performancei7 7800k + GTX 1080 Ti + 32 Gb DDR4 + Samsung SSD 500 Gb is only good to play on lowest settings. GraphicsThis??????????????????hurts my eyes. Devs added sharpness setting but still it's quite hard to distinguish enemy from the bushes. My eyes hurt pretty bad after 30 minutes of playing. Although I have no such spotting issues in other shooters.GunfightRecoil.... Just if to compare it with any BF/COD - I can easily control recoil of any gun. A gun I have just shots in the direction I pointing to. Good aim = good k/d. PUBG just ruins this experience. It feels like your character is not a military guy but a weak junkie with shaking hands.Bugs... Misaligments is a funny thing, this??????????????????just doesn't shoot in the direction you're pointing to, because devs are too lazy to test and it gets explored by streamers like WackyJacky.Broken scopes.. Any scope is physically living separate live with image it's showing that is jumping and blacking out the view during shooting... Very convinient... If it's some kind of realism addition then the implementation of it is??????????????????SoundSound is garbage, looks like the game is capable of playing 3 audio files at time, that's it. Cars are loud as ???????????? for no reason just to make hearing issues for players.Server performanceGetting shot behing the cover, sync failuers, lagging characters, lack of proper shot detection.Game mechanicsSuper slow healing/boosting/vaulting/movements/animation of player actions.Way too long waiting time at the beginning. Devs really should have a close look at COD battle royale beta. Amount of time between player's death and new session actual gameplay beginning should be minimal.Instead of adding well known deathmatch/team deathmatch mode with usual respawn (without skydiving) to game to let people practice gunfight they added usless test island where messing around with dummy targets is far far away from reality what you get when fighting with other players.UIUI just broken, restart button fixes main menu after few retries but?????????????????? why I have to even do this?In-game menu that handles items and other stuff is hard to use fast, it's just inconvinient in general.and of course tons of bugs and cheaters...It'd be great game if devs'd do improvements fast enough.

Yea I'm absolutely a veteran.I had so much great memories on this game not because the game itself but meeting people around the world..With that being said, it's still a ?????????????????? game. -Graphic is great and detailed; However, with GTX1070 it still sometimes drops to unacceptable 30FPS. I do know frame drop is common in battle royale game even in COD Black Out but frame drop in this game is way too common.-Devs make changes in this game way too often: adding non-sense weapon and functions; adding unnecessary textures which people even wont notice.. Because of the Unreal Engine, eveytime a small change in game leads to a huge update like 5-12 gigs. I know in the states or south Korea the internet is fast but there're lots of people playing with ?????????????????? network.-Cheating; No more need to say.  STILL a serious problem;-Crashing; So common that sometimes you literally just cant tell what the cause is. It happens so much.-Lack of respect to Chinese players who devote more than 60 precent of PUBG's selling.-Physics is terrible; player moves like a moron/robot; You cant feel that sense of smoothness like playing COD/R6-Siege/Battlefield. I really want to see COD Black Out and Battlefield V beat PUBG down to?????????????????? Gamers today are too desperate for good games to play this never-be-fixed-and-poorly-coded garbage. I'm one of those players and I'm done with it. DONT WASTE MONEY."

There is nothing graphic or disturbing about the deaths. Just cuz a game has shooting in it, especially if its for the sake of survival, doesnt mean its going to derange anyone under 18. If killing in a T rated game like Uncharted wont derange a young teen than this wont either. Game is very basic deathmatch, yet in a huge open world where vehicles items and gear are scattered at random. I like how despite the aesthetic the gamendoesnt attempt realism. Health bars are adequate, damage is balanced, and bullets go wherever you aim. Younger players may be bored. As longs as you dont expect anything fantastical or large scale battlefield devastation, pretty much anything can happen if you are patient enough. Every online game has its toxic players.

You basically just sit around for half an hour camping doing nothing then when you come out in the end it's a gamble of pure chance whether or not you win.  Yet if you try to make things fun by being more aggressive you lose before getting anywhere near close to the final few people because you end up being an easy target out in the open for all the other people who are camping like you're supposed to.  The gunplay is also very boring.  PUBG may have gotten the battle royale craze going; but there are a lot of other battle royale games on the market that are much more fun and action packed rather than this camping simulator.  This game is a total waste of money and I would not reccommend it at all.

I bought this game a while back when its popularity was on rise. The gameplay is fine and the graphics are amazing. It has managed to receive an overall mixed review, but that is all because of its early access period.Although, the dust has now settled and plenty of people play this game today. There is a lot that can be done in PUBG (neglecting the bugs, that the creators are working hard to fix). It has been my very first Battle Royale game and the gameplay impresses me. Although, I am not a big fan of the genre, but the game definitely has a lot of potential.Recommended for those of you who want to try a new type of online multiplayer game."

578080,3,0,7.65612E+16,115,3,-1,94.2,"28 September, 2018","This is a fun game, if it wasn't so broken. 1. The lobby. I cannot tell you how many times I have had to click restart lobby due to the game not registering that my party has clicked ready up. How this is still an issue is beyond me. That a fully released game, which is pushing micro-transactions on you and forcing you to buy keys for crates while ignoring performance issues, is this broken is unacceptable.2. Desync & lag compensation. Read every other negative post. You will hear the same complaint described 500 different ways.3. Hackers. Ever been snap head shotted by another player through a forest where 50 trees are covering any aspect of your hit box, but someone can lock onto your head and fire back to back shots with no recoil? Or had a flying car chase you as the hacking group does a Harry Potter drive by? Or been shot from a guy across the map in a closet with a double barrel staring at the wall? This game is infested with hackers. Things have gotten better but it?€?s still frustrating that all this anti-cheat client software PUBG comes bundled with isn't working.4. Lack of optimization. I run a pretty beefy rig, but the game engine is so poorly put together it can't take advantage of anything. You would think with PUBG using the Unreal Engine 4, a proven game engine, that they would be able to make something decent, but that is too much to expect.5. Paying for keys for locked crates. Greed. Pure greed on the developer?€?s part to get any money they can out of you.6. Constant stream of cosmetics. This company needs to realign its focus. I understand different departments are at work here, but from a community perspective, how does pushing more and more micro-transactions look when content and QoL patches are sparse and often end up making things worse than they originally were? The game should be stable and optimized before moving onto sucking the community dry of all its money for cosmetic pieces.7. China #1. If there was a game out there that would make you xenophobic against Chinese people, this is it. They love to crack games and use any cheats or mods they can to get an unfair advantage over you. Apparently, it?€?s a normal thing in their culture. 8. The PUBG v. Epic lawsuit. What even. Do some research. This developer?€?s line of focus is so misconstrued with its priorities. See above points for where the developer does or does not focus its attention. They have a track record of choosing the wrong front to fight on and the fronts that need attention being routinely ignored. Closing: This is a good game. The developer had a great foundation and did well on initial success, but they have failed to capitalize on that success and are losing its player base, essentially PUBG is just riding on their initial success and taking all that momentum and driving it into the ground. Fortnite, while similar but radically different has taken a large share of PUBG?€?s player base, and when CoD launches later this year with their battle royale, I?€?d imagine that another chunk of the player base will move on. This game is slowly dying out, granted it while retain its die hard player base, but as you can see from user counts from now to this time last year, the count has dropped significantly and will continue to do so."

One day I'll have multiple 5+ kill games and win a couple dinners and the next I'll be dying before I see people and never even get a shot off half the time. I really hope this game fixes its server issues and opens up a NA west server because getting 100+ ping in the midwest is aids. Despite its faults though, no game has ever brought me as much enjoyment and thrill as this game. That's pretty much the only reason why I'm willing to give this a recommendation.If Bluehole gets their act together and really improves this game, I'll probably go full fanboy again. If they fail to do so, I'll probably jump ship with Blackout and only play this when major updates come around. I wish this game had fallen into the hands of more competent developers, but beggers can't be choosers I guess. I've tried most of the other Battle Royale games (Fortnite, IoN, RoE, Realm Royale, H1Z1) and none of them even compare to PUBG for me. I do realize Fortnite is the better game, but I just can't get into it. I really hope Bluehole can do something to seriously impress me and make me fall in love with this game again, but maybe I'm holding onto a thread of hope. I will always recommend this game though because its like that crazy ex that gives the best head. No matter what I'll always want to go back and scratch that itch.UPDATE 10/23/18----------------------I'm a man of my word and I said if they fixed update 22s lobby connection issues, I would change my review back to positive. That being said, I am still on a Blackout binge and I probably won't be playing this again until they make some big updates. Love the game and always will, but I have a shiny new toy.

Our team got knocked out by a singly guy who was auto locking and spraying our heads in third person view with a m416. He then died to another hacker who was spraying his QBU wildly across map and shooting people in the head every time. That same player picked up a kar98 then started jumping around head shotting people without even aiming down. Too many hackers at all times for me to keep on going. At least until they can fix all the hackers I have no idea why they plan to release a ranked system before they can even fix the massive hacking issue.

Not to mention all the locked crates that you can't open because you don't have a key, which cost real money to open, for a clothing item. Why not give winners of a round a chance to get a key?

Here are the negitives (in my opinion)It can be a running simulator at times,Getting popped in the head as soon as you get an awesome load-out (without even firing one bullet.)The in-game loby chat is a full on autism fest.Everyone is better than me (AKA ""HACKERS"")Anyway long story short, I recomend trying this game if you havnt yet, but find some folks to play it with (shouldnt be hard)Feel free to join us if you want...https://discord.gg/RCawWyY"

578080,1,0,anthraxxx,145,2,-1,856.8,"25 September, 2018","OK.  It's finally time for me to review this game.  The game was fun.  The game was a LOT of fun.  The ""Fix Pubg"" campaign is merely public relations and nothing more.  This game has consistently gotten worse since it was released.  It's almost impossible to do that, but somehow this crew of developers has managed to pull off this feat seemingly without even trying..or maybe that is the problem?  They aren't even trying.  Cheating is RAMPANT.  Worse that CounterStrike before Valve Anticheat.  It's seriously F@cking ridiculous.  I'm a little bummed knowing that there's not really anything else I would get into as much but I simply can't stand to play this game anymore.As an example on my very last game.  I was on Sanhok I was right on the edge of the safe zone when I hear a motorcycle come zooming towards me from towards the middle of the circle (phase 1) uphill and with no line of sight on me.  He (or she) stop their motorcycle probably 50 yds away and start making a beeline for my direction (I was behind a rock on the opposite side of a hill.  While running toward me they stop for a brief second and kill me with one shot while running.I would love to be able to share some of the deathcams I've watched but it's also like, ""whats the point""?  Just want to say that I'm sincerely????????????????????????off.  Why bother coming up with a whole ""fixpubg"" campaign if you really aren't going to fix the issues?Whats the point of adding new weapons with so much rampant cheating?  Pubg is little more than a digital fashion show (people buying all kinds of worthless gear) combined with a cheaters paradise equalling one sad lonely corner of the internet for losers to check out each others skins and hack."

Despite a have a lot of feedback on my mind right now, I'll stick to short description for the sake of simplicity (and not my???????????????pain) Pros:- Conception and general idea - Level of maps detalization. Here like 3 maps right now, and they are just nutz, each of them creating quadrillion of possible outcomes, own unique gameplan, strategy etc. Each of them is a testament of certain qualities / conditions you have to possess / achieve in order to play effectively- Guns mechanics. Bullet drop & speed, various spray patters & attachments variety create a unique combination of guns usage in different situations. Easy to learn, hard to master- Very fun to play with friends. I've meet a lot of good people through duo-ing with random mates from EU mostly- Taste of victory is very sweet, especially if you've made it through fights, pain, blood and struggle- Weapons. Balanced & sick. You can win with almost every set of weapons (I'm not considering melee weapons at all, they still sucks)- Items management. Fast, convenient, and pretty satisfyingCons: - Terrible client optimization. Worst I've ever seen in F(T)PS game with such online. The game became better after Release 1.0 but not that better.  From initial relase passed like > 1.5 year, and developer visually done nothing in the regards of performace- Terrible server optimization. Was shot behind cover? Observing mass-teleportion of players? Teleporting yourself to spot you were 10 seconds ago? You shoot a guy 10 times with AK47 from 10 meters and saw his skull content / guts, but he's still alive, because your shots weren't counted on server? You're welcome, it's still here, after 1.5 year of waiting- Terrible developer that launches pompous campaign to fix own game? And in the end you discover that's it was done for nothing. Sad but true- Skins and microtransactions. Well, it's not that bad. Just ensures that game will live long enough, if there're people who actually buying all this stuff. Yeah, some of them are neat, but I still prefer a stable game instead of bunch of colorful jakets- Terrible client stability. Crashes, I consider them a natural part of this game. They occured 1.5 year ago, and the last once occured like 1 day ago. Despite a ton of reports I've sent with their tool, it's still kicking from time to time- Vehicle physics. Well, to said the least, it's completely messed up, especially colliding mechanics- Ranks ??? )) It's just a joke- Matchmaking. It was not that bad actually, then people demanded region lock, developer decided to appease a crowd, and just ????????????ed up the entire thingSomething else: - Vaulting. Nice to have, but IMO it's done poorly in game- Training field. Yay. The thing game should have had initially, but developer decided to postpone it till august-september'18, thanks- Cheaters. Yes, it's a problem. Yes, cheaters suck. Yes, anticheat sucks. Personally, it's a bleach of every title, and it's hard to deal with it entirely. I've met only 3 hardcore cheates during 1200 hours, one was on flying car (Harry Potter, I guess) and two were just speedhackers with full set of??????????????????inside. Apart from that I had a bunch of WH suspitions and almost broke my report button, so... Nothing else I can do here, and you too folks- Custom games. Nice to have, but the idea to drop from plane each time you die it's quite stupid- Replays / Kill cam. Nice to have, but internally it has a delay or lag, so it's quite hard to make 2 + 2 how your opponents had shot or seen you(DRAMA ALERT)-----------------It's was enjoyable, but painful experience. I hope that someday this game will see the bright light in the end of the tunnel (like DayZ should has been a longtime ago) and will bring happinness to each and everyone (33% of positive reviews, lol, -1 here). I defended this title and believed that the things will change for better (all along 1.5 year ?) but now, I'm just tired"

The most critical thing to me is the netcode/desync issues. I have countless of times encountered enemy's that i have been shooting fullauto with blood flying everywhere but still being the one ending up dead with the enemy just hitting me once or twice. I have encountered times where it felt like the enemy prefirered at me not knowing i was there. But when i watched deathcam he has been well passed the corner and probably saw me long before i saw him. To me it feels more or less like a lottery when in a gunfight who's going to walk out of it alive. And there's tiny things bugging the crap out of me. For an example trying to jump out of a window when being chased but all you do is end up standing by the edge of the window jumping like an idiot. My advice for people thinking about buying is to wait. This game is absolutely on of the most fun games i know but at the same time the worst because of all problems with it.

My computer ISN'T really that good, I can run it on medium, but thats not the problem, its just really laggy and sometimes gets all clunky (I encountered a few (minor) bugs, and people are reporting many more). The devs could probably make it better and fix the issues, but it appears to me that they only care about getting money, and not satisfying their players. Above all, I think it's very harsh to new players.I, myself, had a very difficult beginning. A large number of players play this game very good, and the game itself is hard to master for new players, which makes it really hard.

Found initually they had Third Person mode and then they added First person as well, so I was right at home. the concept of the game play is great, graphics so so, characters of your choosing, weapon customisation as you go, armour or defence items as you find them, drive just about any vehicle, great friends co-op game (squads). Good thing about this game is that they periodically add updates to improve game play :).So try it out yourself when its on a ""Try Free Weekend"", that way if its not your thing then you've lost no coin over it"

578080,1,0,Sir_Destroyer,12,5,1,617.2,"21 September, 2018","layerunknown?€?s Battlegrounds, colloquially known as PUBG (pronounced pub-gee), is if nothing else conceptually efficient. 100 players parachute onto an island. The last one alive wins. An unoriginal idea executed in an original fashion: That?€?s the merit of Battlegrounds.Battlegrounds is the culmination of years of genre experimentation by designer Brendan ?€?Playerunknown?€? Greene. Where contemporaries polish the graphical and technical edges of an established formula through iteration after iteration, Greene has been honing the very formula itself. The game is aesthetically bland and prone to technical hiccups, but compared to its battle royale-inspired predecessors ?€? a few Arma mods and H1Z1 ?€? Battlegrounds is refreshingly accessible.Newcomers who don?€?t religiously monitor video game trends can grok the beginning, middle and end of their first match. Players float onto an island, raid vaguely Eastern European towns or dusty ramshackle forts for randomized gear, and stay within the confines of an electric blue circle that slowly shrinks the map from miles of open terrain to a single square foot, forcing all survivors into the limited safe space.Along the way to the center of the circle, the player eliminates the competition ?€? or allows it to fight amongst itself. Whether the player is sniping from a distant cliff, going house to house with a shotgun or simply hiding in the brush, the number of survivors will inevitably tick down as the blue circle pushes them into a spot like a giant trash compactor of conflict.A few hours into Battlegrounds, you get the sneaking sensation that everything, even the smallest detail, has a purpose. For example, every door is closed when a match begins, so doors exist as doors, but when spotted open, also serve as warnings that you aren?€?t the first person to arrive at a home. Military bases and cities house powerful weapons, but that attracts more players, and thus more conflict. For a time, high-level players began to memorize the direction in which cars would be parked by default, so they could tell an untouched vehicle from a honeypot. The more you play, the more you learn how to speak Battlegrounds.COMPARED TO ITS PREDECESSORS, BATTLEGROUNDS IS REFRESHINGLY ACCESSIBLEThat?€?s the trick of Battlegrounds: a simple arc that ?€? based on the aggressiveness of players, the randomness of weaponry and the spot in which the circle ultimately closes ?€? can play out in nearly infinite ways, depending on how you read the situation from one second to the next. But like a procedural crime drama, PUBG always hits those same three key beats: Land on the island, gear up, survive to the end. Each round has a sense of progress, of growth, of construction.Of course, construction inspires destruction. We humans like watching things that took time to construct be cooly extinguished. Smashed Lego sets, controlled demolition, a player who?€?s collected the best weapons and armor getting pummeled with a frying pan. Because every player knows intimately the effort that goes into building a kit of weapons and armor, they too know the sweet joy of ending someone?€?s game, concluding their 15 or 20 minutes of raiding with a damp thwack to the skull at the last moment.In Call of Duty, even the losers get experience points, progressing them through some arcane skill tree. The same isn?€?t true in Battlegrounds, where players take great pleasure, consciously or not, from spoiling the fun of their peers. To survive a round is to savor the fact that 99 other people did not.The combo ?€? progression and regression, construction and destruction, total success and total failure ?€? gets at some deep existential pleasure, like rubber bands gradually being wrapped around a watermelon until it explodes. Battlegrounds never feels safe, because at any moment your hard work can be obliterated by a fearless newbie driving a buggy directly into your would-be hideout. Across a hundred hours of play, I?€?m most ashamed of the number of times somebody accidentally ran me over while I laid prone in a supposedly safe sniping perch.BATTLEGROUNDS IS ONLY AS FORGIVING AS ITS PLAYERSThis central theme makes Battlegrounds particularly watchable. Since its informal launch in March, millions of players and non-players have flooded YouTube and Twitch to watch matches, whether they?€?re competitive, lighthearted or both. As with a good sport, viewership captures the spirit of Battlegrounds without requiring all the skill and practice necessary to not only participate, but create exciting moments.For would-be viewers, this isn?€?t like so many other esports that feel impenetrable to nonplayers, let alone nongamers. And for would-be players, this isn?€?t like so many first-person shooters of the past decade that created an artificial sense of skill, allowing players to upgrade weapons over time to conjure the illusion of self-improvement.Battlegrounds is only as forgiving as its players, which is to say, the meek shall not inherit its earth. Worse, some players have turned to hacks or controversial noninvasive tools and techniques (stream-sniping, modifying the color saturation) that provide a competitive edge. Some headaches, unfortunately, stem from odd design decisions and fixable blemishes. The game?€?s controls lack the smoothness of modern shooters, collecting items feels unintuitive, ammo and weapon information is obtuse, and high-end graphics actually serve as a disadvantage: Low-end graphics settings remove bushes and other greenery players might use as camouflage.BATTLEGROUNDS STILL CARRIES FLAWS FROM ITS EARLIEST DAYSI am not the first person to say Battlegrounds is broken, nor am I the first to say it doesn?€?t really matter. It?€?s like when somebody tells you their favorite film is Apocalypse Now, but they can name all its historical inaccuracies, plot holes and production gaffes. Greatness can be, and often is, messy.There?€?s a case to be made that Battlegrounds is the defining game of 2017, both one of the year?€?s best games while also being the embodiment of the current video game industry. It?€?s a brash multiplayer shooter set in an open world, akin superficially to the medium?€?s best-selling franchises. PUBG?€?s also an indefinite work in progress, a de facto status it shares with most AAA games with massive teams operating on tight budgets and impossible deadlines.With PUBG?€?s official release, players finally gain access to its second map, a small and open desert stage that, on test servers, often stutters and crashes. And Xbox One owners now have access to a six-month-old version of the game, in early access on console, where its controls and performance leave even more to be desired. And once again, the general reaction is fury mixed with euphoria.BATTLEGROUNDS ON XBOX MIXES FURY WITH EUPHORIABattlegrounds manages to exist within the crowded shooter genre in an unfinished state, and feel both fresh and creatively complete. From its early access launch on March 23 to its official launch today, Dec. 20, its creators have had nine months to repair, polish and expand on their baby. That the most substantial updates have been improved server performance, vaulting and car horns speaks to the confidence Greene and his squad have in the game?€?s foundation.And they should feel confident. Though it?€?s perpetually rough, you get the sense while playing Battlegrounds, both in March and today, that the developers are constructing the game from a blueprint found only in Greene?€?s own mind.WRAP-UPUnlike most popular literature and films, most video games teach you how to read them, which is to say they?€?re as much about the content as how you experience that content. Many games rely on the familiar language of games ?€? red barrels explode, blinking red spots on an enemy mark its vulnerability ?€? only introducing a few new phrases of play along the way. But games that upend established genres or inspire entirely new ones teach new languages, which in turn get polished,"

For the first dozen hours I found the game pretty enjoyable, but after a new patch I experienced frequent frame drops, even on my pc that usually runs it at 70 FPS all high settings. I began playing less and less until I just stopped playing all together. There are also a few somewhat annoying glitches, including a glitch that screws up your screen ratio and a load of gameplay bugs. Not to mention the fact that it requires a beastly pc (About ??700+) to run the game above 10 FPS, even on the lowest settings, though I must admit, the graphics are beautiful. However, if you're into glitchy messes of games; then PUBG is the perfect game for you."

I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to have a great time in PUBG. If you are debating wether to buy pubg or have bought it but you don't like it because ""you're bad"" then get better lol, You need to atleast play 100 hours on this game to be decent in my opinion. If you're just starting off I'd reccomend that you play a few solo games practice looting quickly and testing guns you like and fit your playstyle, then play some squads make friends and enjoy yourself. If you don't fancy playing squads just stick to going solos and blasting Russian hardbass in the aeroplane Omegalul. I've noticed that alot of people say there's too many hackers in pubg and people shoot through walls, It's buIlshit I've never expericed anything like this people are probably getting high ping and lagging which causes them to stay in one place for a certain amount of time until your ping is reduced. I've spent quite a bit of money on this game especially on shroud Skins and keys, I reccomend you just buy the skins of the community market and the keys as well much cheaper. Anyway so my overall opinion on this game is that i't's extremely fun and a great game overall.This is my personal opinion please refrain from any negative comments or flame."

Tl;Dr, It's a really fun game that has massively pi$$ed me off many times.Cons: A lot of large-sized updates that seemingly do nothing.Fairly cancerous comunity (you can mute them so, whatever).I've experienced bugs (mostly minor, some major) that get into the way of the flow.I've had good games ruined by hackers with AWMs multiple times, but hackers seem to not be a big issue now.Loot boxes are basically garbage. You'll spend points unlocking a random lootbox only to discover it needs a key to open... which you have to pay for. (Just spend your points on sex changes like a normal person)Pros:It's an intense shooter experience, something that will get your heart pumping.The controls are easy enough to learn but difficult to master, allowing for room to grow.I haven't experienced a lot of exploited mechanics that I've experienced in other games. (mechanics that give players an edge if they do a maneuver that wasn't intended by the devs, like dolphin diving in COD, or double pump in Fortnite)Getting a kill is massively satisfying and getting your first Chicken Dinner feels amazing.If you're looking for a battle royale shooter with more of a ""hardcore"" slant, this is basically the only option. Well worth $30."

It was an immesely fun, challenging and captivating experience that I will never forget. Since then, I've put nearly 500 hours into this game, with hundreds of Chicken Dinners, and hundreds (maybe even thousands) of kills and deaths. In less than a year PUBG had become a global phenomenon, unlike anything gaming had seen since the days of MW2... Within those 500 hours, controveries started to develop... Loot boxes, issues with gaming and visual optimizations, the list goes on (Thankfully, I have a pretty badass PC, so I never really felt the repurcussions of these optimization inconsistencies)... But I defended it... Admist all of the dissention, I remained hopeful the game would truly become the masterpiece that it initially seemed like it would become, the prized child of Brendan Greene that HE wanted it to so badly become. My friends stopped playing it, and even I stopped playing for a time, checking back every so often to see if it was still the same incredible experience I remember it for......But it seemed that my hope was misplaced...With games like Fortnite, and even Call of Duty's own Blackout, I simply cannot recommend this game anymore. Rather than remaining competitive, PUBG, which was once a shining star in a world of overy-commercialized gaming, has since devolved into a complacent title with little to no concern for it's reamining loyal playerbase. And it's truly sad. All too often do you hear about media that was so absorbed in it's quest for money (*cough, cough EA*), that it lost sight of what was truly important...I'm not saying this game deserves to die. I think Bluehole still has a chance to make things right. But they can't succeed by continuing to ignore the writing on the wall. With games like fortnite that continue to dominate, and games like Call of Duty and Battlefield now entering the BR fray, PUBG is now more vulnerable than it has ever been, and it very well might suffer the fate of H1Z1 if they are not careful..."

But there is a huge downside. Even if they improved many things such as rubberbanding, bugs and so on and also added cool new features, weapons and maps,  they did not work on the most annoying issues: -Chinese cheaters-huge lags and bad server performanceI  never experienced something like this in any other game. And there is no ""early access"" excuse anymore with the official release date almost a year ago. In every second game you die behind a wall (and my ping is always below 50 and my hardware is up to date (i7 8700K and 1080ti, 200Mbs internet. 32GB RAM, M2). There are so many players with really really high pings on the servers that even if you got behind cover you still die. Another thing that proves these super laggy servers is that in close combat you can fire 4-5 bullets and you even see the blood, but in the deathcam there is no shot fired and you get 0 hitpoints.I do not even care about the obvious cheaters in this game. I could live with that and I am sure this is not easy to get rid of. But an easy ping lock (lets say about max ping 100) would solve so many things. But Bluehole does not want to lock out Chinese players on other servers because they are bringing too much money. No wonder the player base is dropping. And with all the new battle royale titles coming up it will further go down. One last thing: please please please bring back the map selection. Or at least bring Erangel and Miramar in a 50-50 ratio. On EU server we experience at least 6:1 ratio. And no one wants to play Miramar."

The amount of hours I put in it don't discredit real feedback about the game.As with TERA, the gameplay is pretty much unrivaled. They're fun and unique games and this is the part they really nailed.But it's been clear since 2011 that Bluehole has no idea how to make a well-optimized and relatively bug-free game. To be frank, they made a ton of money off of a poorly-made game, and that says a lot about gamers as consumers. Random FPS drops, having to try to pick up items multiple times before they actually hit your inventory, right when you drop and urgency is the highest, my plane randomly slowing down and speeding up on the map past when I'd like to drop, my crates taking a minute to open. Hell, I had a fully-loaded QBZ right when I dropped, shot five bullets before I died, and randomly got a message in the middle of my screen that said ""There is no ammunition.""

A lot of things can be harmless or played around, but the fact of the matter is, this game is unpolished and you shouldn't HAVE to. In comparison to other BRs, PUBG MIGHT have the best gameplay in your opinion. If you want to play it over the others, and die to random ?????????????????????t and play a game that feels awful and unoptimized, go for it. I'm going for games with more polish for sure."

Games took a minute and thirty seconds to get in to. The desync was unreal... I could never hit near 60 FPS with a GTX 1070 on all low graphic settings, except for render distance which was Far. The desync with client and servers is unreal right now. I watched a replay that bluehole provides after a game and the dude only shot me through a wall while I had only showed my head through a window once. I don't blame the people that killed me, beceause they probably saw my head sitting still for several seconds and took advantage of it.All in all, ???????????? this game, ???????????? the developers for their ?????????????????? committment to make a decent game. This piece of??????????????????(currently) had so much potential. But, instead of making core mechancis more polished, upgrading servers, and making animations match what you are doing. They decided to add fake ?????????????????????t to prelong this game whil children get their mom's credit card to buy Shroud skins.This game has so much potential. But, everyone will be so naive to expose bluehole and their lack of responsibilty to this game. Because in its current state.

I loved playing it with my friends, I loved the sheer pvp battle royale mechanic, and I loved how it could get my heart racing. I hate writing a negative review for it but I'm truly hoping that it will help bluehole see just how????????????????????????off it's customers are. I have not been able to enjoy this game since the release of sanhok, which in my humble opinion, is when the game went from a slow downhill spiral to a complete jump off a ledge. Just to list off a few examples of why I am giving this game a bad review.Let's start off with the overall bugginess; It is laggy, I experience desync on a fairly decent rig running on good internet, especially when running with friends. I usually have to quit my first match due to it freezing to the point of running what i would approximate around a quarter of a frame per second. Even when I try my graphics on the lowest settings I'm still lucky to achieve a stable 30FPS. Not to mention not being able to connect to the servers that are ""too busy"" despite PUBG running the lowest number of players it's seen in a while. Next let's talk about the devs; There are so many cheaters in this game and bluehole refuses to fix it despite the fixes being seemingly simple. Bluehole launched a ""Fix PUBG"" campaign around 2 months ago. What a ????????????ing joke. It has only gotten worse. The final nail in the coffin that really solidified my opinion.... Loot Boxes. Enough saidI don't even know how to end this review so yeah... I don't reccommend this game."

Even if you had a beastly rig you would still experience heavy stutters and random crashes.But dev must have been doing something about it right? yeah, they released a mobile version and a xbox version that is even less optimized, its a joke 3/10 Makes my rig look like a dishwasherGameplayWasn't sure wheter to include this in optimization or not, you would wonder why, well... because apparently bad optimization gives gameplay features... yeah! first of all, i've never heard of a game introducing a feature like 'vaulting'It's like a dev told you in his next big game presentation that his title will have a huge feature called 'walking'.like wtf? you must be out of your mind to see that as an 'improvement' of the game, its a necessary feature for the type of game, but it was added half a year after the game's release, and not only it came late, it was?????????????????? now we need to talk first how they removed the third person fov .ini fix because it introduced 'unfair advantages' instead of introducing a 3rd person fov slider that wouldnt make it unfair since everyone could use it. now with vaulting in certain spots, you can make you character climb trough floors or walls and see trough, thats definitely a fair advantage! you want to know what else is a fair advantage? the game not loading textures! so you can go trough walls and see trough walls like there were none to begin with (and this was with tha game installed on ssd)3/10 phew phew shoot at enemies that don't see you wowNetworkWorse than optimization, and trust me that's alot to say. The server's thickrate is a total joke, lag compensation doesnt even exist, you can't get to know how much ping you are getting because there's no actual way to know in-game, you need to go to third-party sites to see it, there's a huge amount of dsnyc and you can't even be sure you have actually hit an enemy from the blood splatters because if there's dsync in place your enemy might just still be full healt... a total joke-1/10 the worst i've ever seen, they're not even trying hereSoundWhat sound? directional sound is non-existent, you might aswell play with your head in a oven over at your kitchen and still get the same informations that you would get by playing the game with a decent headset in your room without any noise. If you happen to hear anything you still won't be able to pin point the direction from which the bullet came from and you will look like an idiot taking cover from the wrong side like a pack of ????????????ing fruit, now just think about how's it like to be shot from a suppressed weapon, you litterally have no chance, especially if the game forces you to go trough an open field. Oh and because the core feature of the game is to be 'realism-oriented' you don't get any information by the ui from where you got hit, because ofc if you get hit in your???????????????by a bullet you still wonder if the bullet was shot from the side or in front of you, right? /s4/10 Tries to be annoying more than it tries to be realistic (i said realistic, not good, it doesnt even try to be any good)MovementIn this game you roleplay a blind drunk slug, it litterally feels like that, there's a ????????????ing delay for everything, you want to open a door while you're being shot? ok sure, just wait a couple seconds, wait for the slow animation, you try to walk in.. hit the door, you character looses momentum and you have to wait for a total of 3 seconds to enter a door (yeah there is momentum in this game, you can't just press W and walk, that would be to easy! what were you thinking? nono, you have to wait that that slug of your character actually initiates the animation and starts moving) and this is whitout dsync, if there's any, well then, you might aswell play ping pong with the door, because the game starts to register every imput you gave before opening the door, so the door will open and then close again, very funny indeed, especially when you need to move fast to save a teammate. Same goes for jumping ostacles, if you run full speed and jump something, and hit it with your thumb's nail you get bounced back, lose momentum, you have to walk back, get momentum and try again.1/10 just because you can movePlayerbaseYou got any problem? it's not tha game's fault! it's you! i have a gtx 550 4gigs of ram and an i3 800 and i get steady 100 frames!

The 'Fix PUBG' campaign looks good on paper, but it became the focus of the development team far too late in the roadmap and has yet to demonstrate any meaningful progress. After playing the BETA version of Blackout and seeing first hand how much better it feels to play from the perspective of connectivity, I'm really not suprised that the PUBG playerbase is starting to errode.

I am writing this review after I don't really play this  game anymore.In 2017, I bought this game to play with some buddies. Through the course of a few months there were certainly bugs, ones that made hilarious encounters and others that????????????????????????you off. Overall throughout that time i found it extremely enjoyable to play with friends and every once in a while play SOLO.I recently got back on the other day and most bugs have been eliminated. I am in no way a gaming connoisseur, however, I think people's complaints with this game are a little bit ridiculous and over-the-top.This game is my standard  for the battle royal playstyle. I have played others, and more recently a beta that came  out, and all I can think of is ""this is just a different/worse version of pubg"". So on that note I think PUBG is the king in battleroyal games in the past 2 years, and I don't think I will ever be able to get into another game with the same style."

Yes it?€?s finished and polished.Pubg often takes onboard a lot of criticism from the player base much of its criticism have been worked on and improved. I was playing just the other day with some friends and we talking about the evolution of the game.We now have 3 maps, do you remember when it was just one?Erangel the original, you know we haven?€?t been playing this so much since the arrival of sanhok, but Erangel is the best looking map no question. Sanhok has definitely drawn us away from original map but why. It?€?s got the lot, high action areas, quieter zones too. Last week myself and two of my friends landed on Erangel?€?s Po???????????????i we hit our usual northern side of the town and was quickly down on the ground searching for loot. We were discussing as I entered my 6th house how we wished the loot could be a little less, a little more challenging, I?€?d already found a bandage and an energy drink as I confidently moved onto my 7th house in search of a crossbow or something?  I like the way spawn often spawns in front of your eyes too I think that?€?s quite a nice touch, I sometimes stand in a room looking at the floor and wait for it.Miramar was the first addition, a beautiful desert oasis, a real joy to behold, eye candy even. It?€?s got the lot, blue sky?€?s sea and sand as far as the eye can see if you have an 8X even further. Until yesterday I hadn?€?t played it for what seemed like ages, couldn?€?t think why so we dropped into Miramar for a duo, we had so much fun running on the endless sands. My friend was just saying after the circle moved another kilometre further away for the 2nd time how he wished he could just run all day on the luscious sand.  We spoke of the joy we?€?d finally get to finally see another player. How we laughed when the clatter of automatic gun fire cut down my friend mid sprint, and soon after the mighty blue consumed me while I dodged sniper fire from a distant ant. Bravo. Sanhok this is our favourite map, it?€?s got guns, although we often do miss the running and swimming that erangal offers Sanhok does sometimes offer a run swim race just wish they had pedal bikes for the full triathlon. I especially like how the foliage doesn?€?t get drawn in beyond a 50m no hiding for you Ant sucker.I?€?ve not heard the China no 1 phrase for months, Are they really gone or did I accidentally mute my mic?The cheating issues are being dealt with my friend actually got a report telling him a player he reported is under investigation and had received a ban. Bravo I can remember a week or so ago when cheating was so rife you double checked every death cam. Performance issues getting fixed too for many people, mine freezes for a couple of seconds per game it never used to do this but I know it?€?s in the name of progress as is the excessive load times into server.The crate thingy we love it, you can actually get items on loan for 5 days, I like that they check your new reward against the items you own just to make sure you don?€?t receive something you already have. That?€?s progress.No game like Pubg love it. Thumbs up."

With my 8700k, 1080ti based system i average ~120-165 fps constant @1440p 165hz. That is with everything maxed out except shadows on high. The recent changes to server tickrate and texture streaming has made the game feel even better. I personally haven't noticed any server desync in a few weeks. There is always going to be the kids moaning ""it's garbage"" and FIX THIS FIX THAT but inho the game feels pretty good as is.As far as the loot system. I didn't fully agree with them charging for the event pass but it was a fun feature to have objectives added to the game. Now that they added the Supply system it feels more rewarding again with the daily and weekly challanges. If i had to suggest a few things though they would be as follows. Keys should be acquirable with BP. If you would still like to purchase keys with real currency they should not be $2.50. Maybe $.50.All in all the game feels pretty good at the moment in my opinion. If this is your type of genre, and you like realistic game play, i would suggest giving it a try."

I do however love that it's based off modern military with weapons and things but again is not a game I would play anymore. The optimization needs to happen...

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,105,1,1,316.3,"16 September, 2018","Don't let the vocal minority sway your decision; PUBG is a great game. Hit-reg is better than it's ever been and gunplay is relatively balanced, with a large enough variety to satisfy all playstyles. The pricetag of $30.00 USD was unjustified in early access, but now feels worth the money with a variety of gamemodes, weapons, and maps (with another coming soon).There are cheaters, but the situation is vastly better than it was. When playing on Asian servers I notice the jank more often. If you report a player and they are cheating, you'll get a message acknowledging your contribution after said player has been banned.Also, in regards to cosmetics, who gives a f????k. All the real content is included in updates for no charge (new maps, weapons, vehicles, etc). It's not like Bluehole is dedicating their entire workforce to pushing paid cosmetics. It's as if the entirety of 4??han metaphorically emerged screeching from the depths of their basements to decry this game in the name of fairness to the consumer regarding cosmetics.Highly recommended"

You will never ever get the reponse times when looting, the reg when shooting that US players do on their servers because as per usual, UK players are forced to play on garbage servers on mainland Europe with horrible tick rates.The graphics even at max settings look bitty and unpolished, the recently added sharpen feature makes me feel like it's peeling a layer off of my retinas.The Miramar map is absolute garbage.The Sanhok map is ok but nothing will beat the original map.The looting is horrible.  Open 10 buildings, find 10 shotguns, 3 SMGS and 7 pistols, somehow miraculously always encounter somebody else who landed on top of a Kar98k with a 4x Scope despite your permanently terrible luck.The mobile version of this game is astonishingly better at all of the above apart from the same garbage maps.  That's a huge embarassment.Uninstalling shortly, wish I could refund but I'm way past that point."

Sometimes they just hide in their rooms so I call them soyboys and betas to make myself feel better. But I'm getting sidetracked.The community is far from death, they're just depressed from losing all of their games to Chinese hackers, from whom I've learned great life lessons. For example I learnt not to trust an Asian, especially when he's recommending keyboards....

The first few times it's very tense and exciting. But soon thereafter the games go1. Spend 15 minutes picking up loot2. Wander around and don't see anyone to use it on3. Suddenly die in a sub 5-second engagement, probably without seeing the person who killed you, never mind getting a shot off.The ratio of setup to fun is way the heck off. I know a lot of this is about whether you like the hide and go seek part, and how good you are, but regardless for me the game is a bad mix of boring (walk, loot, wait, repeat) and frustrating (dying very fast)."

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,11,2,-1,124.3,"15 September, 2018","The problem with PUBG on PC - from the point of view of a casual gamer.Let me start by saying that I'm just a ""casual"" gamer - not a hardcore competitive gamer (I haven't played any online competitive games prior to the battle royale craze). I'll also say that I enjoy the battle royale game format - I play PUBG on mobile and I'm fairly good at it (I win sometimes, not all the time, and I average around 3-4 kills per game).But unfortunately, I just can't recommend the PC game. Here's why:The simple problem is the type of gamers that you get on PC - they tend to be experienced competitive gamers, with all the expensive gaming gear.I find that playing on PC has two main problems - one, people just seem to know where you are (somehow they just do). Most of the time I get killed by people I haven't even seen. I can be hiding in a building not making a sound for 5 minutes, and someone will throw a grenade through the window (this has happened to me many times).The second problem on PC is the accuracy that players have - most of the time, I can barely get one shot off at someone before they have headshotted me. I have popped out from behind a wall and opened up at someone at point blank range on full auto, and they still somehow managed to kill me with a single headshot. Again, this has happened many times.(To those who will say that my game strategy must be bad - I play the same way on PC as I do on mobile, which I'm fairly decent at.)Don't even bother trying to play PUBG on PC with an Xbox Controller (which I used to do) - you will just get wiped out very badly. I bougt a proper Corsair gaming mouse (12,000 DPI), which admittedly makes long range shots slightly easier, but I still can't seem to fire more than one shot at somone before they have headshotted me. I don't even like playing with KBM, I prefer a controller, but there's just no way you can play with a controller against KBM players.And there really are a lot of cheaters on PC. I'd heard there were, but I can confirm it is indeed true. I report a lot of players for suspected cheating, and literally almost every time I log into the game I see a message telling me that someone I reported has been banned for cheating.I've been playing on PC for four months now and I've not even got a single win. It's got to the point where I class myself as doing well if I can just land and find a gun. And sometimes I can't even do that - I've been shot and killed on the chute before - no kidding.I'm seriously considering uninstalling and deleting the game now, and buying a console instead, just so that I won't have to play against the cheaters and KBM noscopers.What is needed is matchmaking based on skill level and controller type - so that players with similar stats play together, and controller/KBM players are kept separate. Apparently this is just too complicated to implement though.If you want to play competitive games on PC, firstly you're going to need all the expensive gear - mechanical keyboard with macro keys, high DPI mouse, headset with virtual 7.1 surround sound etc, high refresh rate monitor, etc. (and of course an expensive PC). And on top of that, you're going to need years of experience and practice before you get to be anywhere near good.So my recommendation is that if you're just a casual gamer like me and you want to play PUBG, play it on console or mobile - not PC."

You can get some cosemetics for free so I don't know what the big deal is about. This was one of the first and biggest Battle Royale games before Fortnite came along and ripped them off and after Fortnite everyone seems to want to make a BR call of duty, grand theft auto, and tons of other random developers. Why are sooo many companies trying to copy PUBG? Because, it is a great game that pioneered a new genre, because hundreds of thousands (yes that many) people are playing it. They are still updating it fairly often. I was sceptical at first, but after purchasing it I fell in love. This game is amazing. The graphics are great, gunplay is phenomenal, feeling of winning is the best. I have never encountered a hacker in all my 170 hours that I currently have logged. I don't know if people are just trash and are accusing people that are good of being hackers without even watching the killcam or what? I would really like to know because I don't see it. Maybe they see other reviews of people claiming there are hackers and they just want to jump on the hacker bandwagon I don't really know, but this is a great game and I highly recommend it. 9/10"

Spend your money there.After 236.9 hours...I've played PUBG with an overclocked Intel i7 and an overclocked GTX 1080 with all the fixings that plays all my other games (Battefield 4 & 1 and recently BF V Open Beta, Fortnite, Overwatch, Paladins, etc.) on thier highest setting on a 3k widescreen monitor at 3k settings at its native 100 hz no sweat and no lag,  yet this game lags on my system and I have everything on its lowest settings. The concept is great, graphics look good, yet the execution is atrocious when it comes to the lag in this game (this is only one aspect, but the most annoying). I have waited a long time for a fix and I give up. FIX PUBG is a false promise to entice the wallets of new player that should instead wait for the new generation of Battle Royale games to buy those instead of this game. This game should still be in early access for it is  far from completion. Selling keys for real world money to open loot box/suitcases for aesthetic/ cosmetic items when your game runs like molasses on a top notch gaming computer is a fail to your fanbase, and evidence of your priorities being in reaping money and not a satified gamer. I played this is game because of the player's and what looked like a great early access game, but now am patiently waiting for DICE (Battefield Series) or COD to release their BR games which look amazing and I know will run properly. It would take ton of great reviews for me to ever purchase a game from Bluehole again. I hope this helps someone to wait to buy a better game in the BR genre that has a military sim feel unlike Fortnite."

Like any other game, improvements are always sought out by developers and players alike as they coincide to the life span of the games existence. This game features dynamic gameplay, as no one round is the same. Whether you enjoy thirdperson or first person shooting, this game offers both. Graphics are awesome, player movement is smooth, ADS and scoping are challenging but easily managable as your skills progress, which ultimately sets you apart as an individual  from the rest of the gaming community. This game is as action packed as it is tactical. With over 1600 hours, i can honestly say with all the games i have played this is hands down one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played as far as multiplayer shooters go. As with all other games, there are hackers who try and ruin the experience, but Devs are cracking down and making new improvements every week with bug fixes and new and exciting changes. This game can be played professionally and matches can be run back to back  with little to almost no delay. Patience is required if your not a seasoned gamer however there is a  new instituted training grounds where you can practice your skills before you make the jump out of that plane filled with 100 players.

Aimbots, See every player hacks, Boosted damage, Teleporting round the map, etc etc. And it's all from the same player base. Some say it's because they make money selling the crates or the stuff in them. Others say it's because cheating, bribes and scams are so ingrained into the culture there that they don't see it as negitive trait, ""everyone does it, you have to do it too"". It's probably both those things and more, point is it's ruining a fun game for a whole lot of people, and those people and their $$$ are going to go somewhere else.

You want cool skins and to build then there is Fortninte, if you want faced paced future-is tic then there is Call Of Duty Black Ops 4, and if you want a longer more strategy and realism game then there is PlayerUknown's Battlegrounds. The point is, there are 3 great battle royal games that offer different tastes. ( I am using these three battle royal games but there are more). So for me personally i like a PUBG better than the other ones but i respect the other battle royal games and play them and enjoy them as well. I hope all of these three games keep being great games."

It takes 20 min of looting to so get in a tiny bit of action that might just end in 2sec becouse u die. So basicilly what am trying to say is that it takes to long before things happen as in games like fortnite it takes max 30sec in lobby rare more then 15 sec. Then there is action almost all the time. thats why I play fortnite more then pubg. Becouse I get more out of the time playing fortnite. Have a lot of friends that agree with me as well. They also play fortnite more becouse of that, exept one guy who went back to Leauge of Legends. And the game is insanely big and takes a lot of space, My wifi and computer is fine so dont really care. But most poeple who play the game dont have 280mb per second download speed. So should try to make the updates as small as possible;) But exept from those small things, the game is great! Love the whole concept of making it feel more real and stuff!

I'm a man of my word. As of Update #22 Bluehole has implemented a region lock, which, theoretically, should significantly reduce the amount of ping abusers in the game. I am leaving the initial review up for posterity more than anything. Please note that this review may still be subject to change depending on future events.Edit # 2 - Just going to add this, Update #22 failed completely in terms of region locking the game. It now forces *more* people with high ping onto non-native servers, and has ruined the game experience for me.I'm done with Pubg for some time."

BUT with each update they deliver new bugs or bugs which has been solved already earlier. With one of the last patches they introduced network delay. It is really AWESOME(!!!) if you lose each day at least one match by getting shot behind a wall... If the network delay is not getting fixed soon I am going to uninstall the game, there is no fun left.My personal impression is that they prefer to bring out new skins to earn money than fixing bugs or trying to improve the games performance, shame, shame... and even more shame.I hope they are going to give me the possibility to edit this review soon, but I do not believe in it anymore."

The game was one of the first to implement a Battle Royal system where players are dropped into a large map with 100 other people, and their main goal is to be the last man standing. Other games have used this style before PUBG came out, like ARMA 3 and H1Z1 to name a few. However the impact the game has had in the video game market has left an impact on multiplayer games as a whole. But that was back when it was in early access and was still relevant. After playing 160+ hours on PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, I can honestly say that I am completely done with the game as of today. Everything has led up to this point, including horrible performance in gameplay and frames per second, inclusion of awful microtransactions, and their attempts to 'fix' the game.PlayerUnkowns Battlegrounds, as of 2018, has reach a point that its popularity is steadily declining because of how lackluster the whole experience feels. Many people complained about the lack of overall polish and steady flow of gameplay in its early access days back in 2016-2017. The game would chug frames, even dipping below 60 frames per second if areas were heavily populated and/or alot of activity was happening. Close quarter combat was met with frustration with how poorly the game would tank in frames as you fought someone indoors or in close proximity to them. When the game launched December 2017, maybe people felt dissapointed that the game still underperformed as it was fully released. The same issues that plagued the early access of PUBG were still in the game. As the months passed, people were starting to leave PUBG because of the lack of updates and lack of overall polish the game needed. Although Bluehole has addressed some of the issues the game's had, it still is left as a 'hot mess' to say the least. Even today the game still has issues with firefights as you can directly hit someone and it won't register. However the main contributor as to why the game has steadily declined was the inclusion of microtransctions, especially the 'battle pass' they implemented before the Belgium Championships.Even while PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was in early access, Bluehole decided to implement microtransactions for cosmetic items. The devs tried to implement a system much like CounterStrike: Global Offensive, where players can trade skins for real world currency, and create their own market based on what people value the most. However most of the items that were available during the early acces stage of PUBG were barely adequate enough to warrant someone to wear on their avatar. When the game fully released on PC, there was still no reason to buy any of the clothing as they felt bland and uninspiring. Things got even worse when the full game was released and they included locked crates where you would have to buy separate keys to unlock them. Finally there was the controversial 'battle pass' that cost $10 to buy. What this does was that it gave you access to locked clothing and gun skins as you completed challenges, much like Fortnite. However again, the items the Battlepass offered did not warrant the value or time they required because the cosmetic items were ugly and unattractive. Many people also saw this as hypocritical that Bluehole would implement a system from a game they were trying to sue at the time, and saw it as the 'final nail in the coffin' for them. Although Bluehole has made efforts to fix their past mistakes, it hasn't meld what they have done in the past. Bluehole has released several 'fix' updates to address the issues that have plagued PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds since its release. They have provided steady frames to the game, fixes in performance for close quarter engagements, and even added a few maps, weapons, and vehicles along the way. Although these fixes have kept the game stable, they have not addressed the main issue that plagues the game. The game is a mod of the Unreal Engine, and many of the issues that plague the gaming engine are apparent on PUBG, even more so. Unlike Fortnite where it was built from the ground up, PUBG has many issues that keep it from being excellent. Since the game is a mod it suffers from inconsistencies in performance, especially when it comes to gunplay. Much like PUBG's counterparts DAYZ and ARMA 3, which use the same engine as PUBG, gunplay is very bipolar. If you ever get into a gunfight with someone who has a higher ping in either game, you will be met with devastation as the other player will dominate you. Sometimes it can go the other way where someone can have a lower ping and your bullets won't register, and theirs do. Since the game is very competitive, the lackluster performance diminish the chances of winning; it is all based on luck.As of today I am completely done with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. I have uninstalled the game and will not be touching it anytime soon. I love the concept that PUBG has; the inclusion of customization of not only your avatar, but also armor and weapon attachments to provide more depth than Fortnite has. However because of its lack of polish, the company's past mistakes, and their attempts to fix them have not made the experience anymore worthwhile than when it was in early access. There are too many things holding this game back from its competitor Fortnite, which has become more popular and more relevant today because of how marvelous the game performs and their numerous updates to the game that keep it fresh. Hopefully Black Ops 4 will have a better Battle Royale mode as it seems to be getting alot of attention from streamers. That's why I am not recommending this game to anyone; it is a tragedy beyond saving."

The bugs are plentiful and through much trial and error cannot be fixed at least from my perspective. Unable to play the game because a walk command is forced everytime I aim down the sights not to mention the rampant amount of lag where players can kill you before you see them. Bluehole you turned a decent fun game to play with friends into a ****fest. Thank you."
578080,0,0,Relicgames,92,4,-1,827,"12 September, 2018","This game should be a lot better. If they would fix the dysnc that would be huge. Another change that would make this game worth it is actually giving a crate key for winning rather than only coins would help this game as well, since you know when you spend your hard earned coins on crates you end up getting a locked crate that forces you to buy a key. I have never bought a key i have 1800 hours into this game and i have more locked crates than i can imagine. As well when you finally get an unlocked crate you get some BS item like the weapons crate you ALWAYS get a beige skin.... WTF do i want 18 beige skins for??? My recommendation is dont buy this game, wait till call of duty BR comes out and play that. The creators of this game only care about making money off of you not giving you what you deserve. Again i put 1800 hours into this game and have barley got any good items. These guys literally allowed their shell company, tencent, to make a better game than this with no dysnc and wont allow it to come out into america until PUBG dies. Once PUBG dies they will release that game and make more money off of people while having a well made game. Blue hole Is a POS company... that only focus' on trying to make more ways of making money rather than fixing their game. Remember 1800+ hours.... im not lying to you at all."

It had serious problems (and still does), but wow, there's so many things that it nailed perfectly, and it has seen some massive improvements since then.Of all the BR games out there that many might call ""PUBG Clones"", none of them actually feel even remotely like PUBG.

You can shoot a guy 10000 times with a 7.62 caliber weapon, then he'll turn around and waste you with a vss. (9mm sniper). The owners of the game need to stop worrying about how much money they can make and make the game actually playable. They need major updates, major gameplay fixes. They need to optimize it most importantly. Theres a reason they have a page out now saying ""fix pubg"". If you want to waste time and just have fun, sure its good for that.

It has grown into a asian cheater game, and Bluehole do not want to make actions that fix this for real. The system that sorts people that get thrown into a game by latency is gravely flawed, because asians overflow european servers via VPN and that causes technical issues and the ball is rolling with all kinds of issues with latency and lag. The cheating has grown and do grow every day, since now the player with the most skills is not being honored, but the pllayer with the most divine cheat.. I am not talking about good skilled streamers and such. Look at leaderboards, there are known cheaters leading them and Bluehole does nothing about it. They claim to adress these issues with updates, but in reality this is not a optimization issue, it is a player issue, they need to make a system to perform a totalitary region block, eveen if it comes to the cost of us not being able to pay with friends in other regions. The game is atm rotten and falling apart, and money is controlling what Bluehole is willing to do about the problems. They are an asian company, so I doubt they are willing to lock asians away from the european and american servers. Reason is that everyone cheats in asian servers, that gives them competition even as a cheater. So being a sucsessfull cheater means getting in to servers where less of the people is cheating. And if they cant get into our servers and get results here, they simply abandon the game. That is not what Bluehole wants, so they just slip them thru and tells us they try their best to implement systems to adress issues, but in reality they just try to optomize the code to run smoother and better with the cheaters still connecting. Well that is of no help, I rather play a less optimized game with less cheaters, and more people I can actually comunicate with in english at least in a squad. Singeplayer is not even an option anymore. If you want to achieve something at alll you get better results in squad because then 2-3 of the asian cheaters are actually teamed up with you.. So until this game is fixed or dead its not worth anything."

The downfall of this game was when PUBG made a battle pass. After charging $30 for this game they add a battle pass that you can pay extra for. This almost ruined it for me because I had already bought the game and I was still missing out on the fun. I was fine with the skins and unboxing crates, it added some fun to the game. Then PUBG started making skins only last for a week or two. So after you bought a crate and got your item, you could only keep it for a week or two.

578080,3,0,7.65612E+16,14,1,-1,418.8,"11 September, 2018","So, when I first got this game during Early Access It was pretty fun.  It had its quirks and downfalls, but it was in early access (aka extended beta period) so none of it was a dealbreaker because it was assumed that these glaring issues would be fixed by the time it officially released, at least that's what should normally happen.  But here it is, nearly a year after official PC 1.0 release, and the game is basically as broken as it was in Early Access, if not even more so.  The desync issue alone makes me lose so many gunfights that it is more of an issue for me than the hacking problem.  And the hacking, dear ????????????ing god the hacking.  Around 15-20% of my matches on the NA servers have someone, running some kind of hack. I'm not always affected by the hacks in game, but when you see 15 people within 3 seconds on the kill-feed by one person, all headshots, pretty much a dead giveaway. I just leave those games, because reporting them does nothing.  Sure they get banned, but they can just rebuy the game on a different account and go right back to hacking away because the anti-hack is non-existent.  Due to all of the glaring issues with the game, the sometimes works, sometimes doesn't controls, I defintely would not recommend anyone spending their money on this to support a company that has not listened to its community in any way shape or form, regarding issues that need fixed.  This whole ""FIX PUBG"" campaign is just a last ditch effort to make it appear like they actually give a rats behind, because if they were actually going to ""fix pubg"" there are a multitude of reviews specifying things that need fixed, and they would have started doing this long, long, long, long ago.  They act like they thought the game was acceptable and in a great place. Watch one stream of DrDisRespect play this game and you will see plenty of things that need fixed. I wouldn't buy this game again, even if they paid me to put it on my pc."
578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,98,5,-1,113.3,"11 September, 2018","Just watched the trailer so I thought I'd post a review. If you are watching that trailer and think ""Hey, that looks cool. I think I'll give it a try."" I very much recommend against the game. Occasionally you will have a drawn out engagement with another squad. Usually the typical engagement is against a player, usually foreign based on the insults they are slinging, using one of SEVERAL types and degrees of cheats/macros designed for this game and mass distributed to certain players/regions who want them who will turn right on your head and shoot you dead before you even have time to react. I don't really blame them for cheating though - the game is buggy and the in game recoil is out of control and unpredictable.It isn't all bad though. There is fun to be had by exploiting bugs in the game to have fun with your friends (obviously not the intent of game developers). I often laugh hysterically when one of my friends cars launches up a few hundred feet in the air and blows up upon impact with the ground. However, ultimately the giggle games are not worth the asking price of $30 especially considering the dwindling player base of this soon to be dead game.On a side note - the game developer is based in Korea and the weekly maintenence is scheduled at 5 P.M. PDT. Just another slap in the face to American consumers. Let the game stay in Korea/China and die there."

578080,1,0,Ithurielyoutube,52,2,1,342.9,"11 September, 2018","Now im going to be very honest when i write this. when i first started playing this game it was in early access, filled to the brim with cheaters of mostly asian decent and was filled with game breaking bugs. Did i like playing the game then? Yes i did. I loved the aspect of the game where it was the only BR out there which actually worked and was realistic to a degree. The guns were well thought out and their stats were reasonable. Back then i would of gave this game a solid 9/10 purely for the amount of fun i had playing it.Next came the release of the desert map. The idea was great and made it harder to be hidden in the open, compared to the OG map. More urbanised areas, but in a more centralised area. I had many great games on there and secured a fair few number of wins on this map. However, with a new map came a new wave of cheaters, the early stages of de-sync and a whole lot more game breaking bugs. At this point alot of my original squad had lost interest because of this. I decided to stick around and see if it would smooth out. To some degree it did, they fixed some minor bugs which helped gameplay; but seemed to ignore the bug issues. They added a new car, which in most peoples opinion was not really needed. And then added a new gun as well as removing weapons from the crate. At this point i became fed up with the game. The devs were not listening to what their market was saying and adding things which they wanted and didnt bother fixing the problems we were facing.Sanhok was announced and it actually brought a few of the players back from their dis-interest in the game. it was a smaller map, less urbanised and truely focused on the pure bloodlust a BR game should have. I thought that the game was going to be revived from its seemingly dying condition. And to some degree i was correct. The devs listened to what we wanted regarding content being added to the maps etc, which got a lot of the community thinking that they would fix the major issues reagrding cheaters and de-sync. However, we couldnt be more wrong. They implimented a kill-cam which was suppost to help players reprt hackers in more indepth detail. However, yet again BlueHole didnt smooth it out before releasing it. Major de-sync issues were experienced in the death-cams and it was really hard to tell if opponents were indeed hacking. This in particular really????????????????????????me off. The one opportunity in my opinion to turn this game around, then they went and ????????????ed it up so easily.As of recently they announced 'Fix PUBG' and to be honest, the flaws which were needed to be fixed at an earlier stage of the game are to far gone to be even adressed now. Their intentions with this plan does mean well, however it has come far to late into the game's full release to solve these issues now.I do come back to this game every now and again to see whether i can get back into playing this game seriously on my own again. Do i still enjoy it? Kinda, yeah. After playing other games for a few hours, its nice to come back to the game and improve my general reflexes and tactical thinking. But in all honesty, its only fun to play it with friends and then just doss about; not taking the game seriously.Overall, do i recommend this game? Yes i do, despite its flaws it still hold the potential to get its act together and still be as popular as it used to be. Yes i know other BR games are now out there and soon to be releasing. But PUBG will always be the game, which truely took off the genre. Its a nice game to play when you have mates and want to doss about. its also a great game to test your mind out. But it will never meet the potential it needs to become a proper e-sports game. Yes they have had tournements, but its still not to scratch as CSGO or Dota is.Graphics- 8/10Guns- 7/10Vehicles- 6/10 (still bugged to hell)Competiveness- this varies, but for me its 7/10Overall rating- 7/10"

Overall, the game has a very addictive gameplay and is extremely competitive, and if you are looking for that and only that, along with some decent graphics, this game would be for you, but you have to keep in mind all the other issues you will deal with in the game once you drop.Bugs are the tip of  the iceburg, so many bugs still, this game feels like it still is playing in an alpha and or beta phase, and needs so much work before its considered a fully released game in my opinion. Instead of fixing the bugs and making the game more optimized and quality, the developers and the company decided to throw out as many maps which nice as they are, still bring the broken aspects with them, being equally as unfun as the others. And then as if they needed to make more money before their game inevitably died from their lack of pursuing fixes insteaed of quantity, they make boxes that you need to buy keys for.The lag is not good, at all. The rubber banding, and the ability for players to actually shoot you three seconds after you get into cover because on their screen somehow you are magically still in the open is just nuts. This game is still severely broken, it doesnt deserve to have a price tag on it, and thats why i would not recommend this game.

I uninstalled that game recently after 6-7(?) years of waiting patiently for a release. PUBG fits the gap perfectly, spookyily almost, i still pinch myself to remind me that its an Unreal engine port of DayZ, which is a standalone version of a Mod, that ran on ArmA2, which is a renamed release of the classic Operation Flashpoint.My only request would be more vehicles, a light chopper would be nice. Hell lets just try teams, 50v50, limited vehicles, with 2 Team zones to be captured. Wouldnt take much effort and would match its rivals for more content.Overall the sound of this game stands out above all else, the time delay on distant sniper fire, the delay of Thunder after a lightning bolt, I would give it 10/10 for sound quality.But overall it needs work on various things, stability, graphics quality, and just a bit more content please!Overall 7/10 (needs some work but has great potential)"

In this game it's either always die or you're really good getting 15+ kill games. I, however, cannot be good at this game anymore because I'm banned. For literally doing nothing, either. It's stupid in my opinion and I'm sure others could agree with me. Let me explain.Super relentless guidelines with banning people. I get it, people may use the excuse they were hacked and someone else played on their account but at least give the people who really were a chance. In my case, I probably had one of the most secure accounts with steam guard and everything. A really good hacker got into my account and played PUBG with hacks from his computer. I got banned almost instantly after I took my account back, and I can't even appeal for an unban. It's just stuck at, ""if you're banned, it's your fault for being hacked."" Which is the most f*cking r*tarded thing I've ever heard.First of all, I thought you actually wanted a community following, but this is just mean to some of them. You guys aren't doing great in the first place compared to Fortnite, so doing this is just adding insult to injury.Second, it's not like it's my doing that I just ""let someone into my account"". I don't share passwords or information with anyone, and I'm really secure about it. Just because some russian dude knows how to hack doesn't mean it's my fault that he chose to use hacks on my account. That just sounds r*tarded as if a 5-year-old kid came up with those rules.Third, not adding an appeal for the people like me who think logically is honestly just rude for people not being able to use the $30 they spent with their own money. I get it, lots of people use hacks. Most of the time, they should be banned. But like me who hates hacking and loves a fair game is banned because some f*ckface decided to use my account instead of their own is just lazy on your guys' part. I would appreciate a refund for my waste of time explaining something that you should've known in the first place."

I've been playing ever since it's been available on steam and also bought a 2nd copy for my brother, convinced it was worth it. Now we all have seen the fix PuBG campaign and the list of performance and optimization issues, Definately a con and I understand peoples concern, however it's 100% worth purchasing, I've spent hundreds of hours in pubg, between all my accounts probably around 500 hours or soand I've also tried realm royal & the new BR game Fortnite. While I think fortnite definately has it's niche...In my opinion PUBG is better and hands down a ton of fun to play whether your playing duos with a pal or squad with friends, this game has given me a lot of enjoyment and out of a scale of 1 to 10 to if it's worth buying? Easily give it a 10. Pubg is a wonderful game and with it's great community and a great development team, we will see a lot of fixes and optimizations down the road."

This game works 10% of the time. Frustrating, laggy and unresponsive. Getting killed by laggy players from who knows where who are practically ivounerable (i guess because of their ping) is happening all the time. Almost every game you die behind a wall for unknown reason. Replays are absolutely useless. People shoot to the air in spots where i have never been and i die ( if they aimed at a spot where i was running from i would understand that there might be some dellay but i got killed by a player that was aiming 2 meters to the left of me, and i was comming from the right. I've never been in a position that he shot at). People get hit in the head by Kar98 and live. Even on replay my aim is on point but this trash game is just so out of sunc that it doesnot count theese hits. PRO TIP: Do yourself a favor and dont watch replays.But when the game works and bullets actually fly where you aim and ppl actually get hit when you shoot them its pretty ok. 1/10 for tragic networking"

I always preferred single player games but occasionally played COD4 online and CS. All of these games my aiming and shooting was fine and most of the time I was on top 3 with high K/D ratio. Then I played PUBG on Tencent emulator on PC which is we are playing with players only play with emulators. In that also I had performed well and I have a 5.0 K/D ratio for now and 80%+ top 10. Therefore I decided to buy the PC game. But after playing more than 20 games I could barely hit my opponents. only 5 kills for now all that five from behind after shooting more than 20 bullets. It's not about other players are good at shooting games and I am bad. It is all about registering hits on opponents on the server. Although I clearly hit on the head nothing happens. The hit is not registered. When I searched for this I realized that this is a well-known issue of PUBG. The game I played before I write this review, I shot an opponent on the chest and head more than 10 times, not any blood displayed and nothing happened to him. He was only about 10m away. I think PUBG is full of BUGS. this is the most annoying bug ever on a PC game. Ping issue, server issue whatever, should not be in online games like these. Waste of money."

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,61,2,-1,401.2,"10 September, 2018","This game is great fun when it works but sadly despite all the recent fixes and improvements the game is still in a bad state. Overall the performance issues that plagued the game have largely been resolved, there is still plenty of room for improvement, but generally for most the game runs well and is quite playable. In my opinion the game still has plenty of potential to be a really fun and enjoyable game, but in order to do so it needs to solve the following;1.) Implement effective anti-cheat measures, the game is literally infested with cheaters, without exaggeration virtually every second death is from players with an aimbot, no recoil or ESP. Most don't even make any effort to hide this fact2.) Fix the loot rates on Erangel and Miramar, they were unnecessarily nerfed into the ground (and no it's not just because of comparison with Sanhok's high loot rate, the loot rates were unnecessarily lowered making for an even more slow and painful game - the gear grind doesn't make the game more fun, top notch gear can still be rare, but overall gear should not be so sparse.) There were patches of buildings you could previously hit and would probably kit 2 or 3 people with a weapon, now you're lucky to even get one primary AR from the lot.3.) Oceaning server matchmaking queues are broken, this is obviously only a problem for those in Aus and NZ, the matchmaking bugs have resulted in players no longer even attempting to queue for OC. This could easily be fixed by showing the number of players queuing, not some pointless time estimate. Give people meaningful feedback and the system will work properly.If you are playing this game from NA then you may be less affected by the cheaters and matchmaking problems, as it seems the cheats are most prolific among the AS and SEA regions (OC was equally if not worse while it was still a playable region as it was infested largely by Chinese cheaters, but now the queues are dead the cheaters have returned to plague their own servers).I have had a lot of enjoyment out of this game, the firefights are awesome, the gunplay has a lot of variety that allows for different playstyles to work well. Despite the sometimes janky physics it creates a lot of cool, funny and surprising moments. It's awesome to play in squads, the cooperation and coordination required. There's lots to like about the game, but it's going to be a dead player base real soon if the cheating problems are not sorted out. With Oceanic matchmaking broken, and every game being a cheating scum fest my squad is quickly becoming jaded by constantly losing to players who are blatantly cheating.It's tough to have your game ruined by others, but in our view there simply have not been enough effective measures taken to stop the cheaters (this is not a new problem, the numbers have cheaters has been up and down, and the ratio of real players to cheaters is perhaps now at its worst point). To avoid going on longer than needed I will make one final suggestion, implement a player prestige system where players of good rank and standing will only match with other players of similar standing. New players match with new players, and identified cheaters match with other cheaters. It's not perfect, but it'd be a damn sight better than the current system.If the game improves I will be glad to change my recommendation, but at this time, it is not worth playing."

Bring back the ATARI and the ninentendo... a time where games were just games and not an online store."

Shotguns seem random. Sometimes one or two shot, other times 5 shots seem to do no damage (I know armor and durability come into play still feels like you can trust the damage output even when you consider that).Glitches are frequent.Speaking of glitches. The only time I've ever enjoyed this game is when ridiculous glitches happen while I'm playing with my friends."

PUBG managed to score the golden zone in terms of FPS action, player growth, and tense drama. It left me with many fond memories playing both solo and with friends.However, in the current state of the game, I'm afraid it is very difficult to recommend the game to anyone. The reason being mainly hackers. You WILL meet them. And in a game where it is so difficult to get results, the feeling you get when you are playing in a game where you actually have a chance to score 1st, and discover someone is walking faster than a car at full speed and headshoting everyone from 150m with an SMG is just... very discouraging.There is just no excuse for this kind of service in a game that sold this well. Along with breaking promises of not monetizing the game pre-launch, as well as updates which come at the speed of which a cherry blossom petal falls from it's tree, it is a very depressing thing to see when a company fails to invest properly in their success and takes the easy road of greed.If you are wondering if you should jump in the wagon now, you shouldn't."

Its unfortunate for the actual gameplay though, because thats fun.  the game is just so broken that it doesnt deserve 30$ of mine.  Ive ran into several issues over my time playing this game, and the most recent?  I cant even start the game.  It runs in the task manager and uses up 25% of my cpu and ram while never actaully opening.  This is the only game that does this, and i have tried everything i can to fix it.  ""fix Pubg"" hmm, good luck. i deserve a refund even after 200 hours of gameplay. edit: still a broken game. right now the servers are too full to play.  instead of putting you in a queue and making EVERYONE wait 3 minutes to enter a game, they block you out completely just because you happened to log in at a busy time while those who are already connected are ""grandfathered in.""  additionally, dsync is still bad.  expect to peak a window, shoot a few bullets at an enemy, run 3-6 feet to out of line of sight behind cover only to take damage and die.  you cant blame the players for that.  there is honestly not a lot wrong with this game in terms of an actaul list.  gameplay is great when its working right, truly.  if they fixed server issues, including dsync and server capacity, and descreased the amount of time it took to enter a game in general, the game would be quite enjoyable."

578080,1,0,anemation,83,3,-1,550.6,"9 September, 2018","I cannot recommend this game. I bought it from release and have put 550+ hours into it.I've put up with making it to the top 10 and a hacker just spins in a circle and kills everyone, nearly every game before they really started cracking down on hackers. Even though the hackers aren't in every game anymore, they are still very much active and almost to the extent of old COD servers. I've put up with the amazing amount of desync. I can peek out from behind a boulder and shoot someone 12 times and get blood spurts with each hit only to have them not die. I go back behind the boulder and two and a half seconds later I get gunned down by the same guy in the same spot he was in while not having any possible angle to shoot me at. Watching the death cam, it is as if I was standing on the other side of the boulder when I clearly wasn't. There are many examples. This is only one.I've put up with the greed that pubg has shown. I understand that a company needs inflows of cash and with a $30 pricetag and millions of people buying the game that should be nearly enough. I really enjoyed the first iterations of the lootboxes. They gave me something to play towards as a cool reward. Now that most lootboxes have keys associated with them to buy, I hate them. I don't want to have to play your unoptimized game to pay another $2.50 for a key on top of already paying $30 for the game. No thank you. They should have put the deluxe skins and clothes as optional dlc and not put up a pay gate to what was free in the beginning. They also make money off of the Market trading of the items and boxes.I've put up with the poorly optimized everything of this game. The graphics. The balancing. The simple mechanics of the game. Let's start with the graphics. When the map Miramar first came out, I won my very first game on it. Was it luck? Skill? No, not really any of those. It was due to the fact that a guy crawling through the grass was thought to be unseen, but little did he know that grass stops rendering after a SMALL distance. I saw a dude crawling on what seemed like a desert, but was actually a field of tall grass. I took my shot and promptly ate my chicken dinner. After I reviewed the match, I realized he thought he was hidden and felt my chicken dinner spoil in my gut after knowing that my dinner was not earned, but cheated. It takes a special kind of game where the entire community tells you to put your graphics settings on the lowest setting while only keeping view distance at max, not only to actually get decent frames, but to gain a competitive edge on the other players. Now let's tackle mechanics of the game. The idea of a closing circle where only one survives is okay. The idea that an AC130 would randomly drop crates of goodies for lucky individuals, or those actually ready for a fight is okay. What isn't okay is a circle that randomly chooses where it wants to close in on is not okay. If the circle was always moving and had a designated spot (randomly chosen at the start of the game) this would be better mechanically. I've been in a top 2 situation when the circle has chosen the victor way too many times for this to be a proper game mechanic. That is my opinion, obviously. Now for balancing, HA! I just can't.I'm now uninstalling the game and will never play it again. Thank you for reading my review and I hope I have given you enough information to make your own informed decision on this game purchase."

Know how on fortnight like once every other game maybe you get one or two hackers? This is like EVERY game you get AT LEAST A SQUAD full of em. An that includes wallhack, aimbot, shooting people without LOS, speed hacking super popular, purpose lag tapping so people will take entire clips an not die but kill you in 2 shots(happens all the time)Even when you're having a great game and should win, there is that one hacker every game that unless hes on your team, will steal the wins.70% of the game is getting out dropped by hackers and just getting killed unarmed since everyone hits the ground before you. The rest is hacker/glitch/lag deaths.1% nice game play.I mean.. I could go on all day why this game blows but don't wanna come off to salty..

This game wasn't worth a minute from my time.Let's set aside the numerous bugs,the poor quality of graphics(in my oppinion,turning foliage to very low to ACTUALLY see someone inside bushes is like....wow....),excessive pings,high downtimes,unable to even reconnect times,poor ""survival"" simulation(i have camped but bro,i have seen a replay of one of my many deaths and the guy was inside the building with a lvl1 Helmet and only a double shoty for 25 minutes of the game,REFUSING to move,just cause the circle was closing on him).

Two game killing reasons:#1: Lagg CompensationVery stupid technology that should NOT be used in competitive games. If you don't know what Lagg Compensation is, let these two examples encourage you to uninstall:#1.1: You're 100% certain you hit someone in the head. Yet you miss, and on the replay it shows you missed. WHY? Lagg Compensation.#1.2: You're 100% certain that you managed to escape behind a wall, but you die anyways, as if your butt had expanded far and beyond the depths of the universe, into the black hole of the gun-pipe shooting at you. WHY? Lagg Compensation.#2: CHEATERSDo I need to explain this?It used to be at least ONE cheater in every match you played. However, things have changed... there are more hackers now. In the past you would hope that a team would have killed the hacker half-way into the match. But nonono, now YOU will have to deal with a hacker ALMOST every game.(Just because someone else has to deal with the hacker, doesn't mean there are no hackers. This line exists for the braindead).So what kind of cheaters will you find in this game?WallhackAimbotNo-RecoilWalk-Through-Walls, (No-Clip. Yes, you can be looking at a door, waiting for the enemy to open it and walk out into your line of fire... yet you die for some reason. The death cam shows the enemy peeking through the wall to your far right, taking his time aiming at your head... because somewhere in this cheater's heart, there is diginity, the dignity not to use aimbot, because only noob cheaters use aimbot, real cheaters walk through walls and take their mother fu***** time to aim, right? (S-A-R-C-A-S-M)).Radar-Hack, they see every player on the map.Speed hackAnd other types of hacks that make losers feel better about themselves. Too bad there is no life-hack for them, ha ha ha, get it?#3 Random Bugs, that you would expect would have been fixed after years in testing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8o4TCflbAY---------------So those were the cons, now it is time for the pros:Meh, I guess if you don't take the game seriously and just play for fun, then who cares! Do some roleplaying, enjoy driving around in a car or boat. Troll people like going inside their car, or make traps. Stalk people and see how far you can make it before they realize it. There is plently of fun to have in this game as long as you don't play competitively.- King Ahmad--------------Additions based on comments.To those who keep saying there are no hackers:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pvS6lbFVvUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fd9yTNKOCoConcerning Lagg CompensationYes, lagg compensation is very good in online Player vs Environment situations. But not so in Player vs Player situations. It is just a lazy technology for cheap game developers NOT to invest in many server points spread out across the globe, who instead focus on BIG server points in specific areas in the world. It is a technology born because of the current limitation in data transfer over large distances; to compensate for the discrepancy caused by the physical distance that DATA has to travel; from the processor sending the DATA, to the processor receiving the DATA. The only thing lagg compensation does, is cover up the DATA loss, it doesn?€?t actually solve the physical issue (only a physical solution can solve a physical issue, one progress is IPv6, but that was the solution for a completely different problem). What lagg compensation tries to do is repair the damage VIRTUALLY using a prediction algorithm to decide what really happening. Basically, it tells the server to run a simulation?€? taxing the server?€?s processor?€? all while the game is still running for the other players. Now imagine this process running for every bullet that every player shoots. That?€?s a lot of wasted processing power just to satisfy customers who cry over ?€?choppy?€? movements. But lagg compensation also works with movement prediction technology. Which means that during the simulation, the server will try to predict your movement using what IT BELIEVES you wanted to do. So let?€?s say you hold W, and then you see an enemy so you push A to dodge their line of fire. Here is the funny part. The simulation might predict that as if you were moving forward while strafing to the left, instead of stopping your forward movement. This explains that rubber-banding-feeling where you go ?€?heeey, that?€?s not right, I didn?€?t even move there?€?, it is because the simulation is based on the PREDICTION of your movement, not your actual input. Lagg compensation is actually great for people with slow reaction times, however, for people with a fast reaction time?€? it is ?????????????????????t. Games feel heavy, character movement is clumsy, and unresponsive, even if we have a super computer and the best connection available. But yes, lagg compensation is very important, to give customers a smooth experience?€? however, please don?€?t pretend that it is competitive gaming, because that?€?s just ?????????????????????t."

Now they are adding big ????????????ing updates of like '12GBs', for people who don't have good internet, it would be taking over ????????????ing 6 hours to download, I'm just going to guess that they are adding in more scan bots in the game to permanetly ban more completely innocent players who actually like the game, about the keys to unlock crates to add things to your character, that's a hasty rip-off, there is no way you have to pay to unlock items when they are recived in the first place, these developers are doing everything they can just to grab money like getting 'water off rock', now I'm not going to just watch my internet speed of a 'megabyte per second' try to finish downloading the update, it's honestly better to unistall it, man when I really hated Fortnite for copying 'PUBG', I think I'll turn that thought around and say Fortnite is better even thou I never played it, dam if I ever could I would first take back my money and take back the 70 hours from this game into learning Chinese instead because 'THAT IS WHAT EVERY SQUAD IS, JUST CHINESE SPEAKERS, NO ENGLISH AT ALL."

You bought in crates that required keys ( I have 30 crates in my inventory that need keys, if you caan't be bothered doing maths thats $75 ), new weapons, new skins and forgot about making the actual game better. As soon as you bought in a way for people to make money from selling items on the market place you introduced hacking, I have played 5 games today and every one has people hacking in it. You battle eye does jack?????????????????? You want a way to stop hacking and make people enjoy this game, remove the option to sell items on the market place. You have turned this game from what used to be amazing to an absolute??????????????????experience all becuase you became greedy. Congratulations on everybody hating this game.

There are some issues, yes, but the playerbase has become one that can never be satisfied. Go through all of the updates in the news and see for yourself. Every time they fix something, the players spam for something else that ""needs"" to be fixed. Yes there are some issues, but they don't show themselves very often and anti-cheat is getting better.If you have a lot of friends to play with, this game is an absolute blast. I for one don't play Solos very often, but you can definitely have some tense, incredible moments happen in that gamemode. You can play seriously in Duos or Squads or you can just kick back, relax, and frag out with your friends. Desync has been a rising issue, some days it's fine other days it's borderline unbearable, but when you're having those incredibly satisfying Kar98 headshots or getting a double kill with a frag, you'll forget all about it.There's no reason this game should be mixed on Steam. It's mostly the playerbase that complains ""Why are you adding new content when your game is clearly broken?"" To this I say do you really think the content creation team and tech team are the same thing? There are people dedicated to fixing, and making things.TLDR: This game does not deserve the reviews it has been given. The playerbase usually complains about anything. Yes there are some issues but the amount of fun you will have overshadows that by a long shot."

This game used to be so much fun and was actually competitive, but it's reached the point where the developers only care about pushing new content which ends up sacrificing server performance overall.  You'll feel great after killing someone, but you'll feel even worse when you die to someone that's just peeked around the corner and barely on your screen.  You'll watch the killcam and see yourself out in the open like a sitting duck holding a sign that says ""free kill"".  This game used to require some amount of skill but now your fate will be decided by the crap servers.  This game had so much potential and it's sad to see it come to this, where the developers claim to be focusing on performance with their ""Fix PUBG"" campaign and nothing changes.  I'll miss PUBG.. the old PUBG.. not this money-sink Bluehole brands as their ""game"".  Congratulations, playerbase is down 60% in 7 months.  Hope you've made your nut."

Lighting and shadows, nothing too wild. Weather, I think it's good. The guns animations when reloading and firing, it's okay, Imo. It all looks and feels decent, including the character models. Run animations with crawl, crouch, and prone are pretty good. Now to get into the good stuff. Some people have come across hackers, I have not, surprisingly. Game does have bugs that I am aware of, but I think I may have come across or not some bugs... Idk? Maybe like, the bug where when you land with your parachute out, you can get stuck on a building, and not be able to fully land. So becareful of that one. Idk if anyone has gotten shot across the map yet? Another bug I'm aware of is when driving, becareful to not go too fast, cause you can flip your vehical, and it can start bugging out and bounce around, killing you with it. Just to say, there a lot of bugs! So BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK! I personally have had fun with it, but have had some campers or just dying right off the bat, cause people like to kill you instantly with a gun, or shoot you out of the air... I know people have complained about campers, but what  can you do? It's a strategy Royale game. You're gonna have players play tactical. Do I recommend this game? For my OWN opinion, I do. Only reason why? Cause I literally haven't found or didn't notice anything wrong. But for you, I wouldn't get it. ONLY if you hate hackers, campers, anything you can think of that would turn you away from a game. I'm not very good at this game, but I like to try and have as much fun as I can."

The mechanics are sloppy and overall make you want to punch your monitor and the outright delay and slowness this game has is so painful to play through. The de-sync is off the charts stupid and over the countless updates and 'performance' patches there still seems to be zero improvements, just feels like the devs aren't putting effort into what the community actually wants. The players ask for game improvements and bug fixes yet we receive pointless weapon skins and new clothing items. If they stopped trying to fit the 'fortnite' style of battle royale and focussed on making a good quality game, there would be no issue, yet somehow after however many years this game has been in development it just feels as if its gotten worse since release, can't even play it for a laugh with my mates as it is just too infuriating to enjoy.

578080,44,4,vezoy,60,19,1,464,"6 September, 2018","This is one of the games where I honestly am undecided whether I should give this game a thumbs up or not.In the end, I decided to give it a thumbs up, let me explain why:Graphics:The graphics of this game are great. The scenery and landscape looks very realistic. Erangel and Miramar have a great love for details. You really feel like in depressing rural Ukraine or hot, dry and boring mexican desert. The Mini Royale Map also looks great and gives you a feeling of Vietnam or Thailand, but at least to me it seems like it is different from the two battle royale maps, as if it was never rendered properly. I get that strange white line all around buildings, rocks and cliffs. Requirements:In the beginning I remember the minimum requirements to run this game were ridiculously high and I was lucky my computer can run this game stable at high graphics. But excluding a high number of players simply because they can't meet the minimum requirements seems to be the wrong approach when you publish a game.Gameplay:There still are bugs left, including embarrassing ones like floating rocks or people swimming and floating around or stuck in the ground. But this is nothing compared to the early stages of the game when cars and players would fly around like crazy, you could hide inside a mountain or walk through walls. Fix PUBG is a nice and urgently needed feature because there still is lots of potential to fix the remaining bugs. In total the gaming experience has become much better.Community:There still are some hackers left. But again, compared to the beginning where you'd get killed by someone headshotting you with a Micro Uzi across the map, the number is now really low. Teaming still is a problem which will be almost impossible to get rid off.Conclusion:Yes, this game still has bugs. Yes, they are annoying. And yes, they can even get you tilted. But compared to what this game was like in the beginning, it has become so much better and the effort put in to fix this game is high. It still is not e-sports-ready. But one day it will, and then there is endless potential. Playing this game is super fun and you can find your own playstyle. Rush and kill or play passive and reach the top 5 without a single kill? It's up to you."

Just when you first get into it give it a little time for some adjustment. Actually play the game and don't use cheats to win. Because then you are a loser and will accomplish nothing in life."

Not only do many bugs and awful servers make the game nigh unplayable at times, it suffers from the ""Battle Royale"" effect, in that it can't be a competitive game because it's based far too much on luck. Where will the plane fly over, what guns/equipment will be there, will I find a car or have to monotonously run across an empty field and hope someone using third person to peek behind a tree won't pop out and one shot me?The players are also always elitist ????????????????????????s who don't want to have fun. The game is filled with mic spammers, it promotes camping, and when you queue up for random squads and try to organise your team, everyone just runs off and leaves you to die. The first person mode makes the game a tiny bit more bearable, but it still isn't enough for this to be a positive review. None of these problems are inherently PUBG's fault, more the problem with ALL battle royale games (which PUBG sort of popularised, so I guess it is PUBG's fault)."

While the game itself show a wide area, almost 180 degrees view the inteface itself is another story. The menu inteface was there but all I could see from my character was his mid section, all crotch and there was no way to fix that but to change the resolution to use one monitor. After I switched and managed to customize my character I started a round, I was very disappointed by the washed out look of the graphics, even settings on ultra and two 1080 ti in SLI mode. Its really sad since I was looking foward to play on PC since playing on my S9+ put a lot of strain on my eyes after a few rounds.

You use in game currency to buy the loot boxes, but you spend irl money to buy keys to open the darn things. It wouldn't be so bad if the keys were .50 cents. but no. They are $2.50. And nothings promising you're gonna get the gear you want anyway. It makes the game seem more like a cash grab, since i spent $40 bucks when the game first became popular. If the game was free. I would understand the nearly $3.00 keys. But its far from being free.Overall the game is fun to play. You don't have to get the loot boxes. However it sorta makes currency useless. But if you just wanna play the game and don't care about looks or skins. or any customization ever. Then by all means get the game. However I think these developers make Fornite devs look like Gods.

""Ehh"" One of the first things you see when you launch the game is ""Fix PubG"", like that is a promising sign. Yet there are still a ton of hackers, damage ratios seem off, maps are old, takes forever to get any new content. On top of it.. the clothing and character options are absolutly horrible. Might not seem like a big problem but there is a huge importance to the ownership of your character.. The Dev team seems to have a direction that they have built instead of adjusting to what the consumers are asking for. In other words.. sure buy the game if you are new. You will enjoy it for a bit of time. You will get your $30 worth.. BUT don't expect the dev team to care about your opinion and for that I do not recommend the game to anyone returning."

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,96,4,-1,382.5,"4 September, 2018","If you had bought PUBG in the early days and played it you would have said this game had great potential. For a short time it seemed like it was going well; top game on steam, regular updates, new guns. Exactly what you need in a pre-1.0 game. I accepted that the maps would take a while, it was a detailed first map (considering the dev team at the start), and the extra modes like fog and rain added quite a lot to the game even though it was a small change. However they messed up on the marketing and media of the game. Of course Fortnite would jump in on the money, that's business, and fair does to them they made a valid rival to compare to PUBG that focused on the younger market. Nothing wrong with that. But PUBG were promising things like new maps and guns that were taking too long to be released essentially driving people to leave their game to play another. Plus too much focus was put on more platforms instead of the current users they had. The waiting I could deal with and I wasn't the biggest fan of Fortnite regardless of it being a good game (I preferred the more realistic guns and maps of PUBG, that's it, and being bad at Fortnite) but the thing that slowly stopped me from enjoying the game was the constant updates for the aiming and recoils of the guns. For some this isn't a big deal but for myself needing to figure out the new recoils after every update turned the game from being a quick game that I could jump into whenever to being a chore before being able to enjoy the game again. This game had its time in the sun and I had a lot of fun playing it but the hype has now died. The updates are poor. The new map (4x4) is trying too hard to compete with Fortnite. The community has little to no faith in the devs any more. I doubt there will be any new features that will recover the game (I hope that I'm wrong) and there doesn't seem to be any clear path for the game to get back to what it once was. Removing the fog and rain modes were a poor move which added to the downfall. Why remove a feature that you?€?ve already spent time developing?In all, buy this game last year when it was good. Not now."

Fired a headshot player more or less point blank with a Kar98 and he was wearing a level 1 helmet, it didn't one shot kill. Fair enough. However, I was wearing a level 2 helmet and level 2 armour, was one shotted and died whilst having full health.Also, when the game is minimised, the in game music still plays. Every first game you play, you're stuck at the loading screen and effectively aren't in control of your character until it's too late. Many times in combat, the server lag gets you killed.This a just a broken game with INCREDIBLY poor quality control. It's utter abysmal and need a serious overhaul if this game is to become a success in the long run. As it stands, it's??????????????????and has had very little creative input from the developers. Virtually no game modes other than Battle Royale. Also, very little maps. Very little weapons and just a general lack of variety makes for inconsistent gameplay and therefore is not enjoyable to play. I think there should be a game mode where you can at least start off with a weapon and have a level playing field. Again, quality control is the root of the issue wih this game. It had potential when the game was in beta, it had a charm like no other game I had ever played. Then the game sold out and everyone and their granny got into it like a Christmas that was stuffed with??????????????????This could have been so much better if it weren't for greedy money hungry developers.

The controls and shooting mechanics feel so dated and sluggish. If you were to review this game based off that alone it would get a 2/10 and that's being generous. The only positive side to this game is the map size, but too bad the graphics suck so you just have to look at a lot of ugly crap. I honestly do not see how anyone can play this trash. You run for ten minutes to have maybe a minute of combat. How is that fun?

I used to drop in and wait in the grass while the surroundings load in, now its always loaded before i get near the ground. The game is optimized, your connection will be the bottleneck for most of the game breaking bugs that are possible. Decent connection = ignoring most bugs that are mentioned in the reviews.The game is alot of fun escpecially with friends. Less kiddy than Fortnite but more relaxed than games like CoD or Tom Clancy stuff. That being said it's not the easiet of games, if you are not on point with aiming then you will feel useless for a while. This leads to a nice satisfaction boost when you realize you are improving and can hold your own in a fight.The content seems to be coming out regularly, with microtransactions being limited to cosmetics so you cannot pay 2 win.Hackers are a problem in every game but there used to be alot and that seems to have been mitigated so something is obviously being done about it.All in all a solid game that will get your heart pumping, and great for a laugh with friends."

Later on as I continue to play this game, it became increasingly difficult to enjoy this game as a whole. Usually, I would play in squads because I would like to meet more people and I tend to be more at ease when learning the game. But there are many downsides to playing this game in squads (which I would list in my pros and cons list of this review). In addition, I have heard that bugs, glitches, hackers, and many other common problems listed in other reviews is a huge issue in this game; I faced most of these issues (mainly bugs, glitches, hackers, and teamkillers). Here is my pros and cons that I can think of this game,Pros:-Variety of weapons-Multiple game modes-TPP & FPP-Variety of vehicles-Three maps that one can play on (as of the time of this review)-Being able to play Solo, Duos, Squads, and One-manned Squads.Cons:-Laggy Server Issues-Horrible Anti-Cheating System-Hackers (related to the Anti-Cheating System; also related to what I experienced in playing in squads)-Difficulty to learn as one further progresses (something I have experienced)-High ping players paired with low ping players.-Updates that are unreasonably large (no pun intended; largest I experienced is 12.9 GB)-Teamkillers and toxic players in squads(because of that I have to show hostility when I know there is a toxic teammate in squads; I don't intend to be toxic in anyway shape or form unless provoked)-Useless BP's-Paid Crates, skins, and recently, Event Passes (which happened during the release of Sanhok)-Not given the ability to change nicknames (unless there is an event pass that gives a ticket that allows one to change their nickname for a certain amount time; this correlates to what I am experiencing since people are constantly making assumptions off of my username)In conclusion, I would not recommend playing this game if you are going to play this by yourself. I would recommend that you, the person reading this, should play this with your friends if you want a better experience of playing this game while being able  to learn. Also, I would recommend not spending anymore money than what you are paying for this game.------------------------------------Again, I am writing this from the point of view of an amateur player of this game. I know people would say ""Start playing more,"" or ""It's your fault for not playing enough,"" when it comes with describing how hard it is learning the game. Also, there is not much incentive to play this game, which is the very reason why I have 50 hours of playing this game as of this review."

I thought that there were no hackers at this game or at least not much but I played a game 5 minutes ago and someone killed me without line of sight and when I went to check the deathcam the game just crashed.

The game was fun for several hours, because of the high levels of tension with each match, and the rewarding feeling of killing opponents and turning them into victims. However, the gameplay is repetitive, and promotes campy, defensive behavior, which is not a style of shooting game that I enjoy. Its even difficult to get good at the game because you spend so much time walking and looting and almost no time shooting. The shooting doesn't feel particularly good, and doesn't provide good feedback on whether you are close to hitting an enemy, especially at range. The game does not perform well either.

578080,0,0,genericphoenix,33,4,1,78.6,"3 September, 2018","Okay... here's the deal. PUBG- definately one of my all time favorite games, and definately my favorite right now. I would like to thank the developers for bringing this battle royale ganre to the market. Before PUBG I had never even heard of battle royale. so thanks! But, it's struggling now. bad. And the list of reasons why is very long. Optimization issues, server issues, gameplay issues, and the imfamous loot boxes. It's no wonder it has fallen behind to Fortnite and I'm sure it will take a pretty horrible blow with Blackout now. I think the main problem is that Bluehole still has their heads up their a**! Sure, the Fix PUBG campaign has helped the game a lot, but I think they need to make some serious gameplay changes. For example, they should have two modes- competitive and casual. Competitive would be like it is now- the game doesn't hold your hand at all. But for the love of God, they need to have hit markers, something to know the general direction your being shot from, and make the game faster! I think the reason so many people are leaving is because of one thing- ""PUBG is so f**king boring!"". I have heard this from many people. And they are right. Circles go too slow, campers are everywhere, and a lot of the time I think the death I got was complete crap. I've stayed loyal to PUBG for a long time, but I gotta say that I am not optimistic for PUBG's future. But, I think it has the potential to stay alive for a long time. Here's a list of things PUBG can do to keep itself from dying:-fix server lag-fix optimization-hit markers-general shot directions-private game (like playground in Fortnite)-make faster pace-make everything smoother: character animations, vehicle physics, etc.-join forces with another company. Sorry Bluehole but obviously you don't have your priorities straight.-Crazy idea, but-- maybe go free-to-play? this would attract many people. I've heard from many that they like fortnite better because it's free, and they don't want to pay $30."

The whole charade of ""FIXPUBG"" is utter trash. The only time this game actually went a direction was near the release of 1.0 back in Nov-Dec in 2017.  Back when the normal servers gave my GTX 1070 70fps at max but the test servers let me jump up to the 100's pre and post release. That's been THE ONLY significant improvement that they CLAIMED and actually FOLLOWED through with. I have video proof too dating back to June of 2017. (Little known fact: Devs at BlueHole are originally WEB developers not GAME developers, you have little actual hope of this game improving like they say it will).From then till now they've added nothing but useless features and making the game ""pretty"" but still making it play like a trash can. De-sync, netcode, server lag. They've had more than enough time AND money to find a resolution but yet they add in more microtransactions. Don't settle for a game whose devs won't even treat their player base right. (Think of a time where you had a toxic relationship, and why you even had a thought of giving that person a chance. That is the same you should be thinking about PUBG; Don't settle for less ladies and gents).Bluehole, you would have earned more than $29.99 from my wallet had you optimized the game before adding in more microtransactions.

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,28,2,-1,530.8,"2 September, 2018","Back in 2017 I would of definetly recomended this game, it was so fun and funny. yes you would see hackers but it was in early access so I accepted that. But now in 2018 they added so much new stuff like the 2 new maps. The desert map (mirrimar) was very unoptimized when it came out you could find glitch spots in the mountain and shoot through the mountain and noone else can see you. as of right now it has been fixed but before that map sucked because of that reason. Then the third map sanhok is ok. It has increased loot and alot of cover. But it's just and uninteresting map with buildings. half the map is just bootcamps and the other half is 1 floor houses with some exceptions. The map is so small that I never have to move if your in the middle. I have currently 528 hours on the normal pubg game not the test or experimental I have 551 hours if you include those. I suggest not buying this game and go play fortnite it's a weekly updated game which I love because pubg is like 1 small patch that no one cares about 1 month. And now i guess the have that FIX PUBG article which is a roadmap. all it has is small patches and other small stuff. PUBG is a dying game and it's probally never coming back alive. It is still a fun game but it's 30 dollars for an unfinished game. I used to play for wins and kills when i cared about the game. But leaderboards reset every couple months so its not worth it. I just play it now for the nostalgia and to get kills. I just remembered that the first and second map now part of the same map selection so its  a 50/50 chance that you are get either map. but sanhok is seprearate map selection. Again this game is a bad game but still worth playing if you have a spare 30 dollars and you know you will play for what your money is worth. I will give pubg a solid 6/10."

This game is been trough a lot, and devs refused to fix it and instead threw microtransactions to our faces. The recent updates did improve the game a little bit, better fps and more content but i really hate the devs refused to fix the game for the past 2 years and i really dont belive they are going to fix the damage beacuse the damage has already been done. This game lost its player base really hard, now im not saying this game is dying or anything like that, but its basically being burried alive and the game is struggling to stay alive as long as it can. Community is a bit cancer, just be sure to mute the chat in the plane otherwise you might get banned if you are streaming.  But pubg is still one of my favorite video game, and i really enjoy playing it with someone.Pros:-Amount of guns and customization-Amount of vehicles-Map desings-Overall GameplayCons:-The amount of BP you get has been lowered-Gun play is sometimes is a massive joke, sometimes it works and shots register, sometimes it doenst register-You have a high chance of getting shot while in cover-OptimizationOverall= 7/10 it has a potential to be the best battle royale game of all time, hopefully devs will open their eyes and listen to the community and fix their game."

One guy was even able to spot me through the whole terrain thus killing me without a line of sight.Unless these stuffs are fixed, this game is completely useless because you'll be running through the whole map for like 15-20mins and then will die in one shot, completely ruining the competitive fun of it.And most importantly, there?€?s no way of you to check your ping or loss, thus you don?€?t even know if you?€?re actually in a playable server or not, until you teleport through the ????????????ing map or disconnect and never connect back in.Update: Don't buy it still !!

Plus, the game was half priced!There were lootboxes at first. The lootboxes were not ideal, but they were free! Then the first paid box: the Gamescom Invitational. This was alright though because it was only one box, and the proceeds funded the tourney. That's fine!That's where it started. Then it became the worst of the worst.MICROTRANSACTIONS!When you buy a lootbox with ingame currency, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH LOOT BOX YOU WILL GET! There are free crates and paid crates, which require keys for $2.50. There is 50/50 chance that the lootbox you buy with ingame currency will still require a KEY which goes for $2.50! YOU OPEN A LOOTBOX OF LOOTBOXES AND RNG DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET TO EVEN OPEN THAT BOX FOR FREE!Let's talk about the Battlepass! Bluehole charges people $10 for a for a pass to unlock challenges for cosmetics. These challenges last a few weeks.

Bluehole didn't care about performance until the review bombs started, and now the company tries to place itself as the ""PRO-CONSUMER GOOD NICE GUY"" for making patches when the issues the company is addressing should have been fixed well before the 1.0 launch.NO CONTENT!Content drops are few and far between. A new gun is added once per total solar eclipse and a new map is like seeing Halley's Comet in the night sky.Bluehole drip-fed consumers bad content, made little to no effort to fix their game and instead pumped development resources into microtransaction and monitization strategies.

They haven't added any good features. The controls are still sloppy, unless you are a hacker, then you might get a kill. THis game is pleagued with hacker STILL!!!! They offer no bonus material to someone unless they fork out EVEN MORE MONEY! I paid for the game yet its less inviting that even the mobile app. This game doesnt just need tweeks, it needs a complete facelift. Theres no reason i should land, walk into a building and die because someone could get down on teh ground that much faster than me. Theres no training to better your skills. Theres no way to even practice movements or game play other than getting into a match. SO if you cannot grasp the controls or game play as a master from the start, this game is not for you. As a solo player there is no benefit to this game since I am a casual gamer and not a hard core fanatic. I waited this long to write anything because I had hopes they may do something to make this better and more fun. IT IS NOT. If you just casual play, STAY AWAY and spend your hard earned money somewhere else. The micro transactions they make you do just go get some stupid random shirt is annoying as hell. Why the hell would i pay anything for a key to unlock just a shirt or a hat?? That is absolutly annoying. Theres nothing of benefit to someone in the game. They are just cash hungry and have no concern for the common person playing. Their only concern are the hard core gamers who make them look good. Trust me, you won't enjoy a game like this just trying to do something. Its far more annoying to jump, die, jump, die, jump die... Need I say more. Theres matches where i last longer waiting for the match to begin than actually landing and not even finding a gun to try to defend myself. This game is GARBAGE"

My experience so far with said problems has only been related to a few minor load time issues and one busy server timeout.

The few months has seen Bluehole begrudgling implement some basic functions like muting teammates and being able to report people who haven't just killed you, but these only came about after the game being not only available for purchase, but v1.0, out of early access, and 'eSports Ready' for more than a full year.  That this game still lacks any steam market, still places any unlocks behind an 80%+ chance of a paywall, still only has 3 maps, still has no competitive/ranked mode, still has no ability to region lock servers, can't region lock squads, can't form or return to lobby with a squad unless they are already your friends, still has 10+ minutes at the start of every round with unplayable latencies (due to the wide update area of every player compounded with 'hot drop' areas), terrible texture optimaztion even at low settings, terrible LoD models that DO NOT align with reality/server at range meaning you see things that you shouldn't and can't hit things you should (or things like a health syringe that use as many polys as a players entire head).

When you hear about the battle royale experience, ""THE ULTIMATE LIFE AND DEATH BATTLE"" sounds so exciting and epic. The concept its so good, but the results are full of flaws that make the game a total failure. Here is some of the things that should make you consider not buying it. - Lack of updates: For all the time I have been playing pubg and being interested in the updates, all we have got its an AK-47 with more atachments and a scooter. A FRICKING SCOOTER. The rest were some bad cover ups so we won't notice that the developers are lazy and can't resolve the most important flaw in pubg: Desync. And we are talking about the game that exploded in popularity, gettign to the top 1 most played game in steam and making battle royale a trend. That brings up to the second point.- Desync and other code net related issues: You are all concentrated in your positioning to have good cover against your enemy and *poof* suddently you are teleported to where you were 5 seconds ago, or sometimes in a completely different direction where you were. Other problem is when you are fighting against someone and you realize that you should get to cover cause you are going to lose, and when you hug the wall and dissapear from enemies sight you die anyways getting hit behind the wall. And let's not mention when your shots don't hit, a bit more rare but happens.- You absolutely need other people to play with: The ""ePiC bAtTle rOyaLe ExpEriEnCe"" rapidly converts into a ""Simulator of waiting until you get headshoted by a Kar98 Kurz running around or dying to the enemy in the most unimaginable position ever"" experience. When you look at the trailers the game looks so fun and epic, but when you realize none of your friends has a NASA pc and wants to waste 30$ in this pile of bugs, the game it's not pubg anymore. - Lack of any different gamemodes: The only way to play here it's to parachute into an iland with 100 people and kill eachother, no deathmatch, no team based objective capture, not even a training course or shooting range!. The zombie mode it's just stupid, the same as the normal game, but everyone is a zombie and tries to fist you, and War mode it's relatively similar to battle royale with the exception you get killed before you actually land. Good luck getting into a war mode server tho, they are either completely full or abandoned. - The ugliest and laziest skins I have ever seen: Most of the clothes in pubg look alright and have some thought into it. But for the love of God 95% of the gun skins in this game are absolutely ridiculous. Like: WHOU WOULD PAY FOR A COMPLETELY ORANGE M4, THATS EVEN WORN OUT. I could make the skin myself in just 5 minutes using photoshop. ""But skins help the developer profit so they can continue with it"". Where are the updates then????? The top 1 most popular game in steam, the biggest gaming platform and they still don't do anything with the money.- Some weapons should just be removed/reworked and there should be more frequent balance changes: The machete, crowbar, sickle and some secondary weapons are just pointless. You find them in literally every goddamn house, yet they don't have any special attribute or role like the pan. Most of the pistols are just the same but with different bullet capacity.Or what about M24 and Kar98, they both spawn in normal places, and they have the same role with very few difference, why the M24 exists? Why couldn't it have some new or interesting role? They are just the same. AND LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THE SHOTGUNS IN THIS GAME, IM ALREADY BURNING JUST THINKING ABOUT THEM. You just land in a house and the first weapon you obtain it's a shotgun, then you try to kill a unarmoured player at 5 meters distance, and you dont even take half of it's hp no matters where you aim. You start chasing him to finish him off, you shot at close range and suddetly the pellets decided to go all the other way from his head and then he kills you with an M4 in a matter of milliseconds. ""BUT SHOTUNGS ARE FOR CLOSE RANGE"". You can kill people from one kilometer a far with some sniper rifles, DMRs and ever assault rifles, but shotguns don't even do their job efficiently in close range. - Death Cam doesnt even work: Death cam it's supposed to show you what the enemy did better so you can inmprove in pubg. It has an essential role in the understanding of PUBG but its completely bugged and broken. 90% of the times I click death cam, the game crashes. The 10% of the times somehow works, the replay just shows the enemy shooting the wall or even looking at other direction. IT CAN'T EVEN DISPLAY THE PLAYERS MOVEMENTS CORRECTLY.- Game crashes: You land in school to rekt some kids and when you feet touches the ground the game crashes. ???????????? the player, the game crashes, go play tetris.- Peeking/leaning just feels unnecesary: In my personal opinion, just peeking using Q and E while moving at the same time it's almost impossible, even when after changind the binds so I use my mouse thumb buttons still feels unpractical and weird, although you may dissagree with this point if you like the system.- ???????????????iest optimization: Even with the numerous ""improovements"" to optimization, the game still stutters and has frame drops, no matter how expensive your pc is. And let's not talk about the XBOX version, that crap cant even get 5 fps.- RNG loot: You land in the biggest house of Po???????????????i and find some bandages and an Micro uzi stock. After you step out the house, you get killed by someone that has already a fully attached M249 and level 3 gear. It's a bit exagerated ( maybe a lot ) but that it's how feels to just be unfortunated enough to not find a weapon in 5 different houses.- Vehicles: Cars and motorcycles are not buggy..... THEY ARE THE BUG THEMSELVES. Don't you dare to touch off road with a vehicle in pubg or it will probably explode, get eaten by the earth, launch you in the air or just completely dissapear. Also, when a car and a motorcycle crash, the car just flies away and explodes and the motorcycle stays unharmed somehow. Or other times, you get off the car when it had 1 KM/H and die or you can stop the motorcycle at 100 KM/H and somehow drop without recieving damage.- ???????????????????????? healing system: You have eaten 5 bullets to the chest and head, NO problem just inject this syringe into your bloodstream and 75% of your health is back in a matter of 6 seconds. You have been headshoted in the head with an AKM when you had no helmet? No problem, you friend just pads you in the back 2 times and you are ready to go, and you can do this unlimitedly. There should be a limit of how many times you can be knocked down and make healing items force you to stay out off combat for a while, you can't just survive 5 more bullets just because you bandaged your toes.- Only way of comunication is a microphone: Yes, it is the best, but there are times when you just can't use the microphone to yell at your teammates that he is stupid. Maybe you dont even own a microphone, or it's broken and you can't use it. There should be a team only chat or some voice commands to use between teammates.- The price of 30$: Take a look at games like CSGO, 12$ or even 6 on sale and you get unlimited hours of gameplay without bugs or server issues, Dota 2 it's even FREE, and its 300% better in all aspects. They should do something with the pricetag of the game cause the number of times you ragequit becaue the game it's just ?????????????????????t ain't worth 30$. And I have 40 hours on this piece of joke, imagine if I had 1000. I would have been typing this from a madhouse. Im sorry PUBG, you are just not good enough. Maybe in one future you will get truly improoved, but until then im copletely dissapointed. If, I have some words spelled incorrectly, it's because my blood was boiling at the momen I wrote this. I hope you found this review helpful and changed your mind about purchasing PUBG."

At over 100 hours on PC and 500+ on Xbox, it's just not worth the money. The game had so much potential, but the developers keep finding new ways to screw it up worse than it already was prior to their updates. I gave this game so many chances. I paid $30 dollars for your poorly optimized, buggy game, and then instead of fixing it, your new updates make it worse. The netcode is absolute trash. On my screen, I shoot a guy in the face 10 times and on server side he won't take damage. The countless bugs can be annoying or game-breaking, making you lose to something that isn't your fault. Instead of fixing their netcode, separating players based off of good ping, and developing a structured game, Bluehole does the opposite. Their ""Fix PUBG"" campaign is worthless, and seems to be creating more problems than actually mediating the preexisting ones. I really wanted this to be a good game, I was a huge fan for the longest time, but it's just not good. COD BO4 and BFV will most likely blow this game out of the water. Stop with the cash grabbing and actually listen to those that are giving you honest feedback. This is not a AAA title, and never will be IMHO. Spend your money elsewhere!"

But since then, plenty of other similar battle royale games came out, so the novelty value is somewhat diminished.Anticheat (ATTENTION DEVELOPERS):The only game i've played so far which permanently bans non-cheaters for running legitimate software (i'm guessing VMWare or AudioSwitch). If you're a developer who plays on his workstation, either avoid the game completely or make sure (check twice) there are no running VMWare processes in the background, or any other ""Suspicious"" processes. I cannot find a list of processes considered ""Suspicious"" by their anticheat - Battleye, so good luck.Speaking of Battleye, it a virus-like anticheat system which sends data about all your running processes to a remote server for inspection. I understand having no cheaters in the game is important, but in my opinion that behaviour is overkill.In case you do get banned, good luck -- PUBG support won't give you a specific reason for a ban, only quoting ""Violation of the terms and services"", and battleye doesn't seem to respond to appeal e-mails.TL;DR:Good concept, but laggy and not very optimized.

578080,4,0,grooya,21,4,-1,366,"31 August, 2018","This game is horrible. I've had it since early access and stick to it until a few days ago. All the promises about developing the game, about optimising it, it's been over a year - and the game is still unplayable. A lot of people still play it and stream it - you might say, and yes, you would be right. But just because all those people are used to glitches, bugs, de-syncs, constant lags and trillion other little things, so much, that it seems that this game is actually good. You have to pre-fire at people, in order to survivse some de-sync which might get you killed even before you actually see your opponent. Walls might kill you (yes, you read that right), those same walls that might not provide promised cover and let bullets go straight through them. Basically this game has no rules whatsoever. Everything might, or might not work. There is no consistency in it's operation. RNG shooter. Literal play of chance on how it's gonna behave or how it's gonna work. And I'm not talking about zones, drops or loots. I'm talking about game's engine and mechanics. So after over a year of companionship I uninstalled the game in an attempt to cut down on stress and anxiety that this game will most definitely cause, and forgot about my 30$ investment in a developing game, which I cannot get refunded. But I am grateful for one lesson that came out of this: NEVER preorder unfinished game. Test a released game, and never ever trust promises from the developer.  Hope this helps."

They've taken away the option to pick a region. There are no Oz servers. My pings are over 200ms, I was getting that range connecting to Asian and American servers. What happened to the Australian server/servers. I was getting a better ping of around 30-50ms which is good. Now I'm getting a terrible ping. which makes for a crap experience. This also has nothing to do with my internet. Even before the region lock the Australian server was broken and you couldn't connect to it. Had to connect to another region which was not ideal.

No magic, no cartoon guns, no random insta-building mechanics or jump pads, just modded modern weapons and good ol gunfights.

They even started a ""Fix PUBG"" campaign because they HAD to acknowledge the game was broken due to the MILLIONS of people abandoning it. It's 1:30am right now and I tried getting into a match for 15 minutes, not enough people playing (at least on san hok, the only good map. others are trash).Even with the campaign, it seems to just be getting worse.

Graphics are pretty good. But I do not like the movement of the character. It is very restricted first person shooter games have such kind of restrictions. But at-least sliding at the moment of run, vault to avoid bullet. This kind of basic move can be incorporated. We can see this move in Medal of Honor. Also the game is buggy.

You find a long-range weapon as opposed to your nerf gun of a SMG whilst you have next to no cover AND you have to move so the circle doesn't kill you... so you are then forced to run out of cover, waiting for your demise. Yet you somehow don't get killed by him, you get killed by the sucker sitting behind a rock 200m away with a pixel-worth of their head being exposed (impossible to notice with the ?????????????????? anti-aliasing options and how godawful the game pixelates if you have anything under a 1440p monitor). - In higher population areas, the tick rate of the server actually slows down. In theory, this puts less of a load on the server, meaning the server doesn't crash. Sounds good, right?Unfortunately, that means that gunfights with more people in them (yes that also means war mode) have a HORRENDOUS amount of RNG simply because you are fighting with ?????????????????? tickrates, ?????????????????? netcode and a ?????????????????? loot spawn system.- Not only that, but for anyone running anything other than an Intel-based system, you are??????????????????out of luck. The developers are directly optimizing the game for Intel/Nvidia-based PC hardware, meaning that if you have an all AMD build (or even just a CPU/GPU), you are an afterthought. Unreal Engine 4 is also specifically designed for Intel/Nvidia setups as well, meaning you are DOUBLE SCREWED if you have something like an old FX-8370 or a FX-6300 (less so with the Ryzen CPUs, but still a noticeable drop). If you are like me, and you have a PC that is 6 years old and you just have a new GPU in to breathe some life into your PC, don't even think about doing well in PUBG... Your FPS will be around 60-90 at lowest settings if you are lucky to have a 1050ti/1060. CPU bottlenecks in any games these days are a reality if you have an AMD FX-Series CPU. For those that contributed to the marketing monopoly that Intel and Nvidia have over the gaming world now, congratulations, you successfully screwed over hundreds of thousands (and even millions) of people just looking to play games at the same level as their friends."

I commend the developers in charge of the gameplay aspcets to this game for they have done an amazing job adding new features, vehicles, cars, guns, etc. But unfortunatly all that has fallen short and been trashed on simply because the rest of the company cannot clearly keep up in fixing many of the bugs and server to client issues that have always plagued this game. And honeslty at this point I don't see it improving any time soon if at all. Mainly, because people like me that have been playing since early access have been screaming at Bluehole to push and fix those issues and honeslty it seems like little has been done. Weather it's because they are too busy trying to bring the game to the esports arena which is silly because I don't see how a game with so much RNG can be balanced enough to be competieve but non the less. Or maybe it's because there trying to suck all the money they can out of microtransactions because they know they can't fix the problems. Or maybe because Brendan Greene is too high on his own supply. Or maybe all of the above plus other issues. Regaurdless if you haven't purchased this game and feel like trying it then I probably wouldn't unless some massive changes occur. If you are thinking of buying this game because you wanna get into the competive arena and you think this is your way in then think again. There are way better games that you could get into that are way more balanced and fun to compete in. This game gave me a lot of hope and I introduced it to my friends thinking this is our ticket to some fun gaming. Instead it has brought much frustation and agrovation due to the amount of bugs and desync that still exsists to this day without question. Had a few fun moments here and there but the issues with the game have clearly overshadowed. I wish I would be instead be writing a review that prasied this game but with the current state of the game there is no way I could do such a thing at this current moment in time. Who knows maybe one day Bluehole will pull its head out of it's???????????????"

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,152,5,-1,230.1,"29 August, 2018","This game was fun for about the first two weeks that I had it, back when it was the only major Battle Royal out (sorry H1Z1 but apparently no one likes you). When I first got it it was very.... buggy.... but having come from playing Arma before and knowing the difficulties behind those types of games I let it slide for a while.Fast forward to a year and a half later, and not much has changed. Actually depressingly little has changed. We've gotten a few more maps, and a few more guns that are basically all the same. The most aggrivating part is the lack of increase in gameplay quality in my opinion.I have played alot of FPS games in the past (COD, Battle Field, R6 Siege, other knock offs) and would consider myself above average at FPS fighting tactics and skills. However in this game, I find that much of time those tacitcs and skills mean absolutly nothing because of the poor poor poor netcode. While ping has not really been a problem, its more of the server refresh rates. Gun fights are not fun for me, as I lose the majority of them for reasons unknown to me. Even with me and a buddy that I play other FPS games with have the surprise advantage on a group we've snuck up on or something it seems we still only have a 50/50 chance of winning the fight.The fact that the performance of the game has not improved for me in over a years time, even with the game being as big as it is, leaves me with not faith in the development team. They still have a chance to prove me wrong, but with BFV and COD:BO4 coming with their own Battle Royale modes, its looks kinda bleak for Bluehole."
578080,0,0,centrussteam,43,37,1,27.8,"29 August, 2018","Games like these are games that make me wish steam had a ""so-so"" setting for reviews. As someone that's played every platform of PUBG, I really love this game. There's nothing like it honestly. You can add attachments to weapons during the round which I've wanted in a game like this for what felt like forever, and it has a certain degree of challenge and a learning curve that comes with it. Trying to find what attachments are the best with what guns. Also, the maps are all pretty big and take a while to explore. While this game is really fun and is worth 30 dollars, it is still pretty buggy for a full release, and still isn't optimized like it should be. I understand that the maps are all huge and take a lot to handle them with the graphics, but it seems like time after time especially on the new Sanhok map, random fps drops happen that cost me a kill, or the entire round of the game itself. Like a totally perfect loadout and about to get an awesome headshot, but then the game freezes and the guy i shot at just lasers me. It really is a shame that this happens frequently, but it seems like the devs are working hard to fix that. Anyways, that was my 2 cents on PUBG, I don't hate it nor do I want it 24/7, but it is a solid BR option."

I played since EA, and saw nothing but potential. Did it release with bugs and issues, sure, but what game doesn't nowadays? Was it a little bland with one map? Of course, but it was EA, so I didn't expect much more than that. Were there hackers and cheats taking place? You bet, but nothing I haven't experienced in game during early release that eventually is dealt with at some point. But to have such issues after all this time is just disappointing. I wanted and expected more, but in comparison to other games out, this just doesn't cut it anymore."

For anyone scrolling through the reviews looking for an honest opinion about this game, here's mine:Don't buy it. Just watch people play it on twitch or youtube, because it is not worth you're time or money. ""Fix Pubg"" will never happen, The amount of Bugs makes this game litterally unplayable. connection issues, sound issues, general game mechanic issues & just a bad player base. For a brand new player just joining, you have no chance of winning unless you adapt to the absolute ??????????????? game style this game forces on you which is: it's better to hide than to fight. & if you are going to fight, ambush someone.Way too much is down to RNG. The gun's are unbalanced and it's completely luck based for you to get 1. the weapon you need. 2. the correct attatchments for that weapon. 3. good Armour & helmet 4. Heals 5. Boosts ETC. - because (especially on the old maps) if you don't get everything you need, you find yourself just looking for loot - Which isn't fun. If you don't have enough health after the first fight of the game, Tough, your bascially 1 shot until you find what you need.For a game which emphasises staying alive, you die extremly quickly, you will get melted by nearly every gun. Not to mention, as soon as you hide behind a corner, you can still get shot for the next 2 seconds due to the games terrible connection issues. If you check the kill cam, you are very rarely on it, it's just a video of a guy missing nearly every shot.I bought a brand new pc that cost a Grand and a half - with pubg in mind & I can safely say, pubg runs terribly. UNLIKE ANY OTHER GAME IVE TRIED. The game has crashed several times, at several different points in a match & it gives you no warning or explanation as to why, you just have to accept it.Let me just put this in perspective - COD4 came out in 2007. it is now 11 years later & This game is not even a shell of that. I cannot explain to you how little enjoyment I have recieved from this game & how over hyped it truley was. Because it puts you through so much BS, the fun parts aren't even that great. & Even if you win - then what? there is no progression system, the player stats are always being reset - you can earn crates but then you have to PAY TO OPEN THEM. It is a perfect reflection of the entire gaming industry. & I truley find myself hating this game & I honestly just can't bring myself to even play it anymore, because I KNOW i wont enjoy it. This is the 3rd or 4th time of uninstalling the game - every time i just want to give it another chance, but there really is no point. None of my friends play it anymore & i think i will be moving on for good.This game is dying and i'll be happy when it's dead."

I tried to be open minded about this game I really did. But I wish every hour I have on this game playing with friends who have poor taste in games could be taken back. The bullet drop on this game is a joke the amount of hackers is insane and they are blatant as heck they give 0 ????????????s about covering it up. The gameplay can be fun with a group of 4 I admit. However this game is like an early release game they want top dollar for. At most this game is worth $10 it's laggy, you unlock crates for clothing, but these greedy ????????????ers want you to pay $2 dollars for a key to open up the crates you earn. What sense does that make? Save your money and don't be apart of the hype this game is pure trash. On top of that they have no region lock so you will get stuck with people from China hacking so that they can earn crates and sell them on steam for USD. This game is just a joke over all.??????????????????graphics, Pay for customization of your character, Insanely poor physics that make no sense. I am a former United States Marine and experienced with several weapons so I am telling you this from real life experience. Don't let the 200 hrs I have fool you half of that time is me just sitting in the lobby waiting for my friends to all get together so we could run a game only to have one die when we drop and then wait for 20 to 30 mins till our game is over so he can join us the next game die again and watch for 20 to 30 mins. O ya and the spectating is bugged so sometimes you can't even spectate you are just looking at your dead body while your friends spend half an hour finishing the game. The death cams are extremely innacurate and make no sense. Roughly half my time in this game is just spectating watching netflix on my other monitor while I am dead and waiting for friends to finish a game. If you guys want a good survival game that has great graphics sound effects and actually accurate guns then you might wanna try out Hunt Showdown.

578080,4,0,Despro,125,1,-1,166.6,"28 August, 2018","PUBG was an interesting and challenging game in the first few months. Like any multiplayer game it suffered from people who don't like the 'challenge' part and prefered to pay for illegal advantages. The situation, however, got worse after sellable ingame items were introduced and profit became a driving force for playing (and winning) the game.During the following months I struggled not to destroy any parts of my equipment in rage about those impure, depraved posse of not so heroic clickers. That has been a hard passage for my otherwise so pacifistic (*cough*) soul.After what felt like half a year, probably because it was half a year, the game gracefully turned into something playable again. At least, my subjective impression was that the developers' efforts seemed to bear fruit and not every game was dominated by the folks in the shades anymore.Unfortunately, this turned out to be a short-lived success. At the end of the day, the dark side wins. Maybe it just took the Tubers some time to promote mouse button scripting. Maybe people just got used to being cheated upon and couldn't stand the clean environment. Either way, weapon recoil is a precious game parameter seldom found nowadays. It's not like a now or a then. Not like just getting laid by that one special guy seen in the after-show. Working through complete replays I tend to report half of the players I catch spraying their load. Playing dirty has become more than a bad habit. Social pressure and frustration turned it more into a common practice.As some famous guy once said: ""I want to believe."" But can you recommend faith? I don't think so.."

But I have gotten fed up with the greedy devs and the various other problems that come with this. I like a lot about this game.- You don't encounter hackers often, I have played this game a lot and have only ever encountered one. Most people that say otherwise are just salty that people are killing them.- It is fun and difficult, and you get a nice adrenaline rush late game that leaves your heart racing for 10 minutes afterwards.- There is a lot to do and a good amount of content.But, there is also a lot of cons.- Terribly optimized to the point it can become unplayable at certain times.- Devs do not care about players and are greedy pigs.These are general pros and cons and I don't really feel like sitting around for 15 minutes thinking of more. But let me be clear: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS IT IS ON SALE. It is definitely NOT WORTH the asking price. This game has a lot of potential, it is already better than Fortnite and most other battle royale games out there. But there are just too many problems for this game to be worth 30 dollars."

Start looked good with the updates and stuff, and no one took this game seriously at the start. ( Okey maybe i did bit bcs i wanted in scoreboard's) I was top 50 sometime)I think first mistakes was the anticheat system because it took so long to come. Im glad its somewhat fixed now.You do sometimes still encouter a cheaters but its better.I didnt like that u blocked the trading either, it makes u seem more money hungry and wanting people to open more boxes( I think it was partly because the Chinese cheaters farmed BP and then sold them for earnings )I was really excited for Miramar from the videos, it was beatiful atleast for me, but then the truth hit me.So many houses with literally nothing in them, i covered more house ground than entire RozHok and still had pistol and some bad loot. And the circle would fk me badly if i tried to go for ""Safe Loot"" Witch i dont really do but this wasn't fun and thats what this should be about I dont really like that u removed fog either i was really liking it. It brought whole another playstyle, you could sneak up to players and stuff, it was fun. Why did u add 6x scope? No one asked for them. They were what i call ""Useless Update"" simply because that time there was alot more critical things to address.Also i think you'r devs handled accusations by Mr.Grimmz towards other players unfairly.( This was long time ago )I love Shroud and so does alot of people, but if you have rules you need to follow them yourself aswell.I dont think StreamSniping is allowed by rules and Shroud stream's literally everyday so why didnt u ban them?It was probably due to marketing trick. And that also makes u seem bad in my eyes. I know company needs money I do really. But rates on the ""Rare"" drops are insane aswell. Im most likely going to win lottery and fk Kim Kardashian in same day rather than getting one of those items. And now you cant even sell them.There was alot of good aswell in this game, its fun with friends, games CAN be fast paced if u land on "" HotSpots ""and when u die u are going to find new game almost instantly. ??Sorry for bad Engrish*PS.

There is no secret to this game, it comes down to mostly luck and some form of skill. Some games I manage to get to the top 4 or 10 and then I dont come close to it for days. The challenges in this game are finding loot quickly, moving cleverly and having good reflexes. The next big challenge is choosing a place to land, some places that had good loot before are not going have the same loot next time around, so it's a guessing game that can either benefit you or be to your detriment hence why I say this game is mostly about luck. The next challenge is the aiming and zeroing, its really hard to master and when you  are only getting a few minutes of gamelpay each round it's hard to get the playtime in to master the aiming, so you are just left playing over and over hoping you get the right shot, the right distance, and you have the right gun or scope. The final thing is this is the only game ive played where I have to turn my settings down to gain a competitve advantage, my rig can run this game on ultra but im stuck having to turn most settings to low due to rendering mechanics of the game. In conclusion, if you are a big FPS fan then this will be great, if you dont have a beefy graphics card or pc then this is for you, however if you are not really into FPS games and have good pc then stay away or wait for a special."

So much so, that after a month of playing the game on my iPhone, I decided to make the investment and build a new gaming pc, just to play the official version. (I am normally a mac person and would have never thought in a million years I would buy a pc).  I own a ps4 and not an xbox, so it seemed to be the best option since there was no evidence of the game being release on the ps4 anytime soon. $2500 and 1 week later, I was playing the game (I am now single, thanks to it) and I have absolutely no regrets. Initially, the transition from console to keyboard and mouse was very tough, even with me being an experienced FPS gamer on console. Luckily, it continues to get easier and easier the more I play. As expected,  I have not been able to stop playing this game. It is challenging and every match is unlike the last, so it never loses my internest.  I am excited for the upcoming training map which will be avaible within the next few weeks, since I found it very useful on the mobile version. The game runs smoothly and I rarely have problems/ lag while playing. There are updates all the time including new skins, guns and weapon adjustments. I hope bluehole will bring back the option to use OPSKINS to trade the skins (using wax) since this would definitely bring in new interest. I paid $19.99 for this game from the Steam website."

But it became worse after every ""Update"" Bluehole made. The loot spawn rate on the old maps is compelte trash and and the weapons aren't balanced anymore. The grenades are way to overpowered and broken at the same time. The playerbase has turned into complete trash. And the so called ""Bug-fixing"" isn't helping at all. I experience more and more bugs nowadays then I used to when I first started this game. Bluehole doesn't care about it's community, e.g. see the redzone. Many players hate the redzone and they told Bluehole and they were so happy after Bluehole took it down for a weekend. But Bluehole put it back up. Another completly broken thing is the vehicle handling. All cars except for one have??????????????????handling.The only thing I can say to all the people that want to buy this game is: Don't get it and save some money."

For me, the netcode isn't perfect, but it gets the job done. People say they are always dying behind walls, I haven't had this issue. People are saying that the hit detection always misses hits for them, I haven't had this issue. For me, I either hit them, or just flat out miss my shot altogether. Maybe PUBG just really likes me and just hates everyone else, but I haven't had most of these problems, and the ones that I had earlier have somewhat gone away.

And guess what, nobody forces you to spend any more money than the 30 euros for the game. And what's that whining about the Miramar map? It is a good map which has way more variaity in landscapes and tactics than Erangel. If you want to play a dull, boring shooter in which you play basically on one small map play CS:GO.

And ever since the market place has existed it has turn crates no longer free to unlock and just is a big insult to original players who were able to get items for free, well,, atleast after earning in game currency after matches.Problems:The servers are very unreliable, on some days it could be fine with no crashes or insane waiting times. but 80% of the time the game spawns you so late where you sit on a loading screen for 10 min only to find out you died in return. The servers also have a very or the game in genral has very bad of ping or player to player combat as although you might have aimed and shot a player while seeing blood dhedding off the enemy a lot of the times it does not register leading you into frustration and questioning youself are you really that bad of a aim.The game suffers from very unstable FPS drops during game play. Yes the game offers V Sync or smooth FPS but it does not hid the fact that a lof of the times even if you have a GTX 1070 the game struggles at medium quiality after the alst few updates. It also suffers from very poor rendering speeds of the landscape leading to unnoticable object in some combat situations with could be vital."

I was the reason i got killed and i realized that to be better at the game. this game is just garbage. wether its getting killed in cover, you land before someone but they are mobile before you somehow? or you land on a tree about 10 meters away and kill yourself from the fall. do not purchase if you want an optimized and fun game to play and hopefully climb up the ladder."

It's unoptimized, hit registration is awful, the networking only barely gets the job done, and it's overall extremely unpolished. And in almost a year, very little has changed to improve it. But they sure spent a lot of time adding maps, guns, and cosmetics, instead of actually fixing the gameplay.The only reason this game had any sort of popularity is because it was the first game to do Battle Royale in a significant way. You're better off getting Black Ops 4, which has actually decent hit registration and gameplay, or waiting for Battlefield V.Also, the game has terrible anti-aliasing. You're not going to get the game to look anywhere as good as it does in those screenshots unless you supersample the game, which with how unoptimized it is, would take an extremely high-end system to perform well."

Sooooo, I was fed up with the game and I finally went and ""bought"" a hack, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?!?!?  you can see everyone who is hacking in the game! NO WONDER it was so easy to die to these cheaters. You look back and it all makes sense how they knew exactly where you were, how they would shoot you before you even turned the corner! this stuff tells you where all the loot is, distance to loot, what floor its on, distance to next closest player, theirr inventory, do you want to shoot them in the head or the body to make it less suspicious, recoil, auto load, auto heal, EVEN FLYING CARS!!!! I was sitting there with the hax active and I was watching the last 8 players all look at eachother through the walls, it was so funny because everyone knew everyone else was hacking. Players started making their avatar nod yes and no through the walls because they knew other players could see them. It all makes perfect sense now. What a chit game. Steam should be ashamed they even let PUBG sell the game anymore.  Anyway, I got banned for using the hack, (I knew it would happen, just a last final fun hurrah), and said so long to PUBG.

Then that is when updates seemed to be a thing of the past I now regret, honestly ever playing this game. Optimization, broken promises, senseless and dumb content, and many more things I'm sure the creators are exhausted of hearing about. In all honesty, ""Fix PUBG"", sounds like it will be a flop, things may change but not necessarily will be fixed. I heard about fix PUBG and thought maybe I could try it again for old time's sake, but once as the game crashes and even fails to start on my high end gaming computer, I am once again disappointed by the outcome of this game and no progress. Maybe one day, the games that are released will be actually finished and perfect. I used to remember when the price that one paid for a game was worth it. This is simply another example of how the gaming industry has become lazy. There's no fixing this game. In reality, the only people who actually want to play this are the ones who want to be hype haters, instead appreciating well made games. And surely, PUBG is not a well made game.

To remain the last survivor is the main idea of this genre. In our case, we do not just appear somewhere unclear where, but we jump out of the plane and choose the landing area that suits us the most.There is a fairly large map, a lot of weapons and body kits, various vehicles. All you need for a good crazy brawl here and there) the game also has a kind of currency, which we buy cases and get the armor. And what falls to us from the cases can be sold and it is very pleasing. The game has 3 types of gamessolo( every man for himself and hope only for their forces)Duo( game with a friend, you survive in 2 and compete between other players)skvad( you unite in a group of 4 people and fight against the same groups of people)The game is constantly updated, add new weapons, armor, and more. On E3 2017 showed a new animation of the hero associated with parkour (looks good it will greatly facilitate the task of jumping out of houses or jump over the fence) I Advise you to buy this game, even if you do not have anyone to play, one is also very interesting to play!

You probably see all those people down in the review section complaining about how laggy and poorly optimised the game is. The truth is they probably just have a bad pc. I use Geforce now on a 2015 mac book pro and i run it at 60 fps on ultra settings with no issue. I played this game for 5 hours straight without experiencing any lag issues. Ping depending on where you live could vary hugely since there are only so many servers around the world. I personally haven't had a ping issue and my ping is always below 30. The biggest problem for me right now are all the Turkish people in the European. I can deal with Russians and Chinese as most of the time they atleast try to communicate with you in english. But Turkish no! Every ????????????ing game i que up there are always Turkish people who just talks to each other with ear??????????????????mic and expects you to understand everything they say. What pisses of me the most is that they don't even try to talk with you if u don't speak turkish. If you are gonna ????????????ing speak turkish with your buddy go queue up ????????????ing 3 man squad or duals.  It has got to a point where I'm forced to switch to NA servers in order to play squad while experiencing 100+ping.

Sadly, none of that is going to happen. Blue hole studio pushes hard for draining player's money in any way possible while totally ignoring that their game is broken and full of bugs. It feels like they just decided that on top of 30??? game, they will implement every possible microtransaction you can think of. That sort of behavior would be understandable for free to play game developers, not when we are talking about the studio developing a game you buy for 30??? which is utterly broken and literally everyone is waiting for fixes.To add insult to the injury Bluehole decided that they should sue Fortnite for ripping off their idea. I have never played it, but seriously guys? Battle Royale is not even the concept you invented. And from the videos it looks like the game is very different. If this is one more of your attemps to get money out of people, well, well done then. I am dissapointed and done with this game. But it was a nice try before greediness over took you."

578080,3,0,kubanahafanana,13,2,-1,165,"24 October, 2018","Honestly? This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The hit detection is inconsistend after maybe more than a year of complaints. Developers dont give a damn about fixing broken stuff or improving obsolete mechanics which are in game but there is no reason to use em. For example melee is utterly BAD 5 hits with machette won't kill ur opponent and dont get me start on how difficult is to hit somebody with a melee weapon. Honestly its far better to not pick any melee weapons up, just rely on ur fists. Pistols - another useless weapon class. Seriously u wont hit??????????????????with them and even if u do they do abysmall damage. Now for the juicy part - CLIENT SIDE HIT DETECTION (done wrong) in this game, having low ping is seriously the biggest drawback you can have. Huge ping players keep hitting you behind corners (for maybe even a second after you found a cover behind some wall) I seriously cannot count how many times have I been killed by a headshot when I was standing behind a wall (my perspective, deathcam perspective)Dont even think about using M16 or MK47 these two are the most obsolete weapons ingame cuz tapping fire is just bad and these weapons are calling for buff for ages now. Hell even ARs in general are just bad weapons with terribly small damage compared to the tons of recoil u get. Whats the optimal combo to use? UMP/Vector + DMR/SR <- if u dont have this, dont even think about reaching top 5. Community is made of total ????????????????????? - tactical thinking will get you killed many more times than win you anything because u cant even think of how stupid ur opponent is and u will get surprised when u wrongly predict that after taking bunch of shots at you he still did not change the position and is camping the same ol rock he has been for ages. Campers in the middle of NOTHINGNESS not even at the middle of the huge playzone seriously sitting 5 minutes at the same place aiming at the same little window. People are so hell bent on just winning the game that they dont pose any competition whatsoever and the game due to HORRIBLE WEAPON BEHAVIOR is based on camping rocks and praying to see your opponent cuz he made a mistake by moving from one building to another.And those weapons - I mean lvl 3 military grade kevlar plates get shredded by a ????????????ING SUBSONIC 9mm ammunition which is doing maybe 2 points of HP less damage than a 5.56 high velocity supersonic military grade ammunition shot from an assault rifle - WHERE THE ???????????? IS REALITY in that... ARs are ??????????????????, some weapons are literally not even worth considering to be picked up. Military helmet is total ?????????????????????t and wont protect you from nothing.Developers are as skilled as in the patch they fix 3 things but screw 5 more I mean literally when I uninstalled the game it was due to me having chosen an option to queue ONLY to the First Person Perspective mode and being queued despite this into Third person perspective (developed for ?????????????????????) for 5 times out of 10 times queueing into the game....I mean ???????????? pubg I uninstalled the game intending never to return and HAIL EUROPE PLEASE GET RELEASED"

I will even play it some more until my friends have other games we all own and are willing to play.I mean, I love the idea of the game, the fact its trying to be on the realistic side of things and the fact its a game you can actually work together with friends is a massive plus in my view. But, and this is the more important thing, it runs like crap (even on a 6 core with a 1070 gtx) and the devs are either incompetent or just plain greedy. With the amount of money they have made and the time they have had they could of had a team of (actually talanted) programmers completly re-write the game from the ground up whilst we made do with the original un-polished game.Instead they fail to make it better (aguably worse usually) and they seem to think somthing like jumping a fence is a 6 month buildup ticker tape parade event. News flash devs, every other game has this sort of thing from day one because its almost as basic as running.Granted, it may have been a small team to start, but this long in with that much money its just ridiculous that its still where it is today. This is a prime example of a good idea that regardless of how much is made the people involved arnt smart/motivated enough to pull it off. Unless they intended on making loads doing next to nothing right, in which case they smashed it. Its not only the devs to blame though, if half the people on here stopped buying the cr@99y cloths and skins they wouldnt spend all their time creating more of the cr@p but thats the way it is these days.If you havnt bought the game by now just dont is my advice, its never going to get there, if it were going to it would have by now."

There is definelty high points and low points to this game, like how when you kill pople and win with your strategic plaining and advanced thinking. And really the only Low points to this game is just not finding people, and most of all the D-synk! That is really the only thing that really needs to be perfected before this game is ready for new maps, guns and vehiclas. I love this game! I have no problem with the things that are added, but then agen I would rather see a more polished game. I like the gameplay. I like all of it. just little things make this game either unplayable or just dificault. Now, I had this game back when if you had a 8X and a Kar98 you win the game becuase of how rare the 8X was. Witch is what i feel like drove away many players. But now if you get your hands on a Kar98 and a 8x its  nothing.

I got in about 3 days after 1.0 launched and lots of fun was to be had. Around when they released gun skins, the game went downhill for me. The progressive monetisation striped the game from the heart it used to have for me. Paid crates everywhere. By the time Sanhok came out, I was pretty much done with the game, but I thought I would give it another try. Sanhok was too little too late for me and the Sanhok pass was insulting. At this point the Oceania servers are dead anyway and pretty much nothing was done to help the numerous de-sync and server issues.What is left is a shell of what was once a game full of potential, the life drained out of it by poor developer support.  Apparently over 50 million copies sold can't fix unreliable servers and optimise the game so your average gamer can even run it. I can't recommend it."

This game is fun for a while, but like anything it can get stale. I find it way more fun to play in squads with friends, but solo can be fun sometimes. Hopefully the devs continue to update this game and make it better. The Sanhok map is a step in the right direction imo. The other maps are a bit too big, and a lot of times you end up running/driving across the whole map without seeing a single player. The smaller Sanhok map fixes this by making all the major loot areas close enough to each other that once you clear out your drop area, you can move to the next area and have people to fight. So it gives a good pace of looting and shooting. A lot of people ???????????? their pants over the competitor to this game: Fortnite. Imo Fortnite is a stupid cartoon baby game compared to this. I don't like the art style, it seems so goofy and casual. Plus with it being free you know everyone's little brother is on there spamming dead memes into their mics with prepubescent, nails-on-a-chalkboard voices.

The game is firstly not worth the money, not even 15 euros (it's only expensive because of the popularity). All in all it could have been an amazing game (popularity aside), but things like this, stupid things actually is what makes me hate it (PUBG Mobile at least has more realistic hit boxes and you can kill someone on close range).

All of these negative reviews come from people who are either; Too young for this game or prefer to be the majority and say PUBG is bad and prefer Fortnite. Fortnite doesnt have the same quality as PUBG.  This does also play into the other reason, which is that the younger kids like Fortnite because it is so much easier.  PUBG was developed and made for Teens and adults. Fortnite was made for Teens, then adapted for younger kids. So when you aplly the rules of PUBG which is meant for people who are harder to beat, to a game meant for little children that don't have to much experience in gaming, it gets easier.On a side note, PUBG brings plenty of new content keeping the game fresh. On the other hand their balancing is questionable. Things like how the UMP9 is so buffed up it's pretty much an AR, makes absolutely no sense! They do also need to add some more anti-hacking measures. Overall I think you should buy it. Hopefully the Fix PUBG campaign really helps to better improve these problems and bring more content.

I was able to search for games in Asia servers, SEA servers and NA servers more frequently in like a few seconds before the recent update but now i find myself having to wait for like 5-10mins or more. Its not even a sure thing that i am able to even play a match such as playing the desert knights event war mode, which now takes a long time to find a game let alone play the dam match. I usually play the event mode alone with random people and enjoy it but i find myself not being able to play it anymore. Before i had no issues playing the war mode event minus the occasional lag and connection issues but now i find myself rarely finding a game on any server which was not the case before but when i do find one the desync and lag is so bad that i dont have a fighting chance to land on top of an enemy to try to kill them then after i get disconnected from the game eventually I do like this game but im not recommending this to anyone at its current state. People who have decent connection should at least be able to play a match without intense desync or lag or even be able to find games. I can understand if im in Asia and the game im in is a server in NA so there is bound to be lag or connection issues but to have those issues in the Asia servers and SEA also is making it impossibe for one to enjoy the game.In all of the hours playing this game i find that this update has made it hard for me to play and enjoy it at the same time. Its like they take 3 steps backwards for every step forward. Please optimise this game into something that is play-able for those who have decent connection. There is also this issue i have been facing for awhile that whenever i pick up a gun it does not load in for me to use such as to re-load the magazine nor let alone equip it. Its frustrating to get killed by someone knowing you had picked up the gun first but unable to retaliate back."

I cannot tell you how many bugs are still in this game, how many cheaters there still are in this game and how awful the gameplay is becoming. I really want to like this game, I really want to continue to play this game. It's the only moderately-realistic battle royale game out without all the stupid extra unrealistic ?????????????????????t. But BlueHole still can't figure out how to properly compress a game, how to properly get servers that actually ????????????ing work and won't just region lock the ????????????ing game so we don't have to deal with so many cheaters in NA servers. It's insane how many problems there still ????????????ing are in this game and it makes me sick. Billions of dollars and it's still impossible to possibly buy new servers? Or maybe even iron out the horrible ????????????ing lag that you get at the beginning of a match? Is it really this ????????????ing hard to hire people who know what the ???????????? are doing in terms of game-development? If all of these problems could be fixed, that would be awesome! Great! I would recommend the game! But I can't. I mean, these ????????????ers give so little of a ????????????ing??????????????????about their player base that they have the special ""event modes"" under their worst category possible in the game. The War Mode garbage is a joke and shows how truly ????????????in' broken this hot piece of garbage is. You can be landed for over 30-45 seconds and someone's gun isn't rendered already. So you have no idea if they have a goddamn gun out, so you're just seemingly getting randomly shot by someone's finger guns! Congrats, Bluehole! A lot of AMAZING changes you've made. This game is gonna be dead as a ????????????ing doornail by the end of 2018 if my name isn't ????????????in' dickcheese."

Can't even find a game Monday - Friday on Battle Royale due to no players. Week nights I am forced to play Sanhok or play with 150 Ping in another region. I use to have 20+ friends who played this game they have all quit also. Bluehole are only in this for the $$$ not the love of the game or it's fans. Rather then fix things like netcode, or introducing new features in game they simply release new crates you have to buy keys for to unlock. The amount of money they are making you would think they would hire more developers to make the game bigger and beter but sadly they keep the same development staff who worked for 6 months to release a new gun (The Beryl and a step in scooter in game)."

They added the feature to select maps, which were a GREAT inprovement, but now they've removed that feature, and that is quite anoying, since i really dispice Miramar, the map feels and plays bad IMO.

Everyone is mostly complaining about de-sync and how buggy the game is but really, it's not THAT bad, I find the game to be fair most matches I play, and while yes, the de-sync and bugs are frustrating and they NEED to be solved for the sake of this game, It doesn't make the game unplayable. As of late it also seems like pubg is really caring, adding and removing stuff that the community does and doesn't like, the training mode for example. I also see people saying ""why are they adding skins instead of fixing the game"" which is plainly dumb. The engineers working on server side performance and the game itself are not taking their time to add skins. Another team takes care of that. So should you buy PUBG? Well, I'd say there's currently no other game like it right now, i really enjoy the gunplay and overall feel of the game(especially when it works) and I am able to overlook the bugs and de-sync from time to time. So yes, I think PUBG is worth it. And it will become even more worth it as time passes."

I've stood by during all the bugs and while most of the time they were manageable and often funny bugs, this game has hit it's all time low in it's current state.  You want to play a first person game?  Well you better hope other players don't get the bug that gives them the ability to use third person, because that's a new bug in this recent patch.  That's just one example of the many bugs this game has, which are present in the test servers, and bluehole still ignores and pushes out to production so they can force more skins to buy down your throat.This game has ZERO Quality Assurance, they roll out patches that break the game even more on a weekly basis.  Don't waste your money on this dumpster fire piece of code.  I can't even call it a game anymore, it's just a bunch of garbage code put together in an attempt to be a legitimate game."

Crates or loot crates will make or break a game (EA) mind you yes PUBG crates are just cosmetic but they are still selling for a pretty penny. This to me was probably the most looked at when the developers wanted fans to keep coming back and yes I almost agree with that, to me that kept this game fresh for me, and I even get locking a crate once every other season or two would make sense to me or why locking them would make the hacks less interested in playing this game. but to me, as an actual gamer it isn't fair. yes, the game lags and I got sniped with an impossible headshot a few too many times. I almost feel bad because I genuinely enjoyed this game. it makes my heart pump and my mind think of ways it never had before. I'm not a coder by any means but I believe you are all thinking inside the box and should start thinking outside of it. Maybe adding a lvl system too the player base may start helping out the bots become less involved in the later part of the game, once you reach lvl 30(or more) then you can start getting points and can start buying crates and thus forces the hackers to go through the game legit. For me I Believe this would be a great idea and as long as the community checks their death cams with this kind of idea you should have a cleaner game."

This WAS one of the most fun battle royale games to play with quite the active community that had so much potential to be one of the best games on steam. But that potential was squandered by BlueHole by attempting to copy elements of Fortnite while simultaneously suing Epic Games claiming that Fortnite copied them. I remember back in late 2017 and early 2018 when all of my friends and I would hop on this game together and enjoy a couple rounds to try and get that Chicken Dinner, but from the looks of it, those days are all but over. The servers are full of cheaters and hackers that make the game unplayable. Bugs are still rampant and the developers don't care about anything but making money. But one of the biggest slaps to the face was the Battle Pass system and loot crate design. Expecting people to pay $10 USD on top of the $30 USD for the base game for a buggy, cobbled together piece of trash is just insulting and the current loot crate system is just a shameless ripoff of other systems like CS:GO except this one is poorly put together and not fun to utilize. As much fun as I had with this game in the past, I cannot recommend it in it's current state due to careless developers, cheaters, bugs/glitches, and overall horrible experience. As much as I hate to say it, you're probably better off playing Fortnite at this point."

Graphics were pretty good and looked realistic. And then came the twist, for my first few games I got killed nearly at the starting of every game. Didnt bother much as I was a newbie. After sometime I started to check out my death cams to realise that I was being killed by cheaters using aimbots and maphack. Also the desync was a big issue. honestly, out of 3 in 5 games I get killed by a cheater while you devs dont do anything about it. Matchmaking is worst as you throw us newbies with pros. Atleast make a rank division to separate them from us. DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GAME I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE EVEN A CENT ON THIS GAME."

I am sick of being killed by cheaters in this game, of having obnoxious Chinese commercials played on loop at full volume half the time I join a group game (seriously, the people who do that can burn in hell), and of dying to the awful server performance and Brownhole's unwillingness to address the ping issue.

At the start the bugs were heavily overseen and many werent created at that time and many sat in hoping the developers would fix many issues however after always just recieveing new content and never major server fixes gameplay fixes and bug fixes i started to lose hope and went from playing 10 to 15 hours a week to maybe 1 or 2 max per fortnight. I make this now so i can hopefully change this once the games devs finish their new endevour FIXPUBG, with the devs new realisation and dedication i have faith PUBG could become the powerhouse it once was and what i want it to be."

Instead of fixing the current content, they release more broken content and MORE LOOTBOXES. The currently loot sets are up to $20 now, which was the cost of the game when it first released. Not only that, but they game still doesnt work. Hit registration doesnt make sense, recoil is a joke, and you can kiss region locking goodbye.just to show you what kind of developers these guys are. In the time of its release they have, put ads into the game for chinese clients, they have added lootboxes and cosmetic items (breaking their promise), they brought the game out of early access just to raise the price tag, AND NOW THEY ARE SUING THE COMPANY THAT MADE FORTNITE.

Sure, it is not well optimized, but I am content playing with low graphics on my current system as this game has not only spawned a host of other great games, but it executed well in the beginning all things considered. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT THOUGH IS EVENT MODES. I love the 8 player mode, and grouping up with a bunch of friends and not being so limited by party size, but for some reason, PUBG Corp keeps deciding to do a Deathmatch mode. Don't they realize that if we wanted deathmatch we would play Battlefield, Call of Duty, or some other AAA title? The shooting mechanics and graphics are fine, but when you compare it to Battlefield... It's just not as good. The hardcore, team-work focused, unique game-mode is what makes this game awesome.BRING BACK 8 PLAYER EVENT MODE! THROW AWAY DEATHMATCH!"

In early access, it was easy for me to forgive a lot of the bugs and FPS issues (particularly because I had a ???????????????op back then as well). However, in September of last year, I purchased a high-end gaming laptop. Specs are as follows:GPU: Nvidia GTX 1060 (4GB VRAM)CPU: Intel Quad-core i7-7700k 2.8ghzRAM: 8GBNOTE: This rig is capable of running VR at a stable 60FPS when not locked at 30 i.e: Fallout 4, SkyrimIn its current full-retail release, this game is straight garbage. Allow me to explain. Many of the FPS issues and lag problems still occur. For instance, whenever I take damage, my game will freeze from anywhere between 0.5-2 seconds (I am not kidding and have recorded gameplay when this happens) despite having the beefy above specs which ultimately results in my death. Additionally, occassionally aiming down sights causes a freeze of 0.5-1 second which actually caused me to lose the drop on someone and get killed in a match I just finished. Texture loading is still unoptimized as, again despite the rig I have, FPS drops still occur even after having been on the ground for a couple minutes.tl;drI have a beefy???????????????rig and this unoptimized pile of garbage game still runs like?????????????????????"

I go ahead buy the game and appreciate it even though there are lots of bugs because devs sound caring about their game. Over time not much gets fixed except graphics. Devs start caring less about game and more about money and add microtransactions and/or DLC even before the game is near finished. Game stays crap for years. Devs announce official release of game. Game still sucks after 1.0 update. People start realizing devs aren't going to fix the game even when devs say they are. People leave. Game slowly dies.

Greed and disregarding your fanbase's concerns yields a drop in customers as well as reputation. I will write an honest, unbiased review based off of my gameplay experience and thank you for taking the time to read my review. *For the sake of the review I will include the whole entity of PUBG (head company/developers/publishers) when I mention ""PUBG""*Going back a few years, I spent a good amount of time in DAYZ:SA. I really enjoyed the loot/survival aspect, but the game was being developed far too slowly and I was ready to move on. I hopped on the Battlegrounds train while it was in the beta stage and I was impressed. In the midst of a growing market of battle royale games I decided to give my time and money to PUBG because I anticipated a lot of great content. Normally I pray the rosary at the thought of ""early access"" games and throw holy water on pre-orders, but after reading several great reviews I wanted to see what the hype was about. From conception to release, the game seemed to grow exponentially and everything was going great. They even had 2 crates, Suvivor and Wanderer, that you didn't need a case key to open. Was this CD PROJEKT RED manifesting in a different form? Everything was going well until the introduction of paid crates. The core things I like about PUBG at this moment in time are:*Diversity of weapons*Diversity of attachments*Character agility (vaulting/jumping/crouching/prone/swimming)*Vehicular maneuverability*Vehicular diversity*Access to every building, making it feel immersiveThe core things I dislike about PUBG at this moment in time are:*Clientside lag*High ping players being grouped with low/moderate ping players*Paid Crates/skins*Bluehole trying to scrape as much money before the game capsizes*Useless weapons (crowbar/machete)To me, this game feels like a cash grab. Instead of fixing their netcode, separating players based off of ping, and developing a structured game, PUBG does the opposite. It caters to a younger audience that doesn't know any better about the prinicples of gambling, attempts defaming Fortnite instead of taking some ideas and implementing them in a better way, and bases the game off of an economy. Anything that is based off of economic gain, and content not in the interest of customers, on a fundamental level WILL collapse. Once the economy runs dry, so do the developers and the trend follows all the way through to the top, whereas the opposite will happen if you keep your customers happy. What's more upsetting is the ""FIX PUBG"" button in the menu on the top right once the game loads. It is up to the developers to create, patch, and improve a game while listening to the player. Instead I get the feeling that our concerns go in one ear and out the other while continuing to release new crates/skins/clothes.Dean Hall promised so many fans a working DAYZ:SA, but once he reached his financial goal, he ran and left the DAYZ:SA corpse to rot in someone else's hands. History repeats itself.Vote with your wallet. Do not support this game or any others that are more interested in your hard earned money than they are interested in giving you a fun, memorable experience.At the time of this review being published, I have logged 275 hours into the game."

It is extremely competitive and therefore there are also many people who chose to hide throughout the game, which can sometimes be annoying, but it is part of the game. Once you understand the way people play and their tendencies you can take advantage of their situation by for example nading a house which they are inside of. The final 20 is usually very intense, especially in Miramar, where there is very little cover. Luckily the game provides three different maps: Sanhok, Miramar, and Erangel. All three are different, with Miramar and Erangel being large and spaced out, while Sanhok being smaller and the games being faster. In order to be good you have to learn how to play on each map. One of the things the game could use is offline mode or the option to have a shooting range to practice, such as in CS:GO. I wish I could practice using different weapons as I know that would improve my gameplay a lot. I also wish the queue time would be shorter, as a couple weeks ago it was great, and has since became quite horrible. Overall I would give this game a solid 7/10, as it is very fun and time consuming, however the terrible server waiting time and the lack of practice facilities is something that makes this game hard to commit to."

The reason Fortnite took off so well is because it did what this game wanted to do, but it did it with more stability, and didn't charge players a cent for it. This game is still optimised like trash, there's no players online, match wait times are appauling as a result, there's next to no insentive to play other than to get little bits of coins to buy loot boxes that contain nothing of any value.If this game was free, it'd be a different story. But I paid $30aud for this. And I've managed to get about 10 games out of it. More than half of my 11 hours of currently recorded time is me just letting the game sit on the match search screen while I do something else and hope to god I get a match. I quit playing months ago. But I came back just recently to have another go at it, and found that I wasn't able to get a single match in 2 hours of searching.Honestly I want a refund. This game is great, but it's not worth the price at all. If you buy this game now, you will be affectively throwing away $30aud to get a piece of software that takes up a few gb of space on your computer, and does nothing else."

Driving mechanic and physic in the game is also quite interesting even though it is quite annoying when your car especially bike flipped out of knowhere when you are trying your best to get inside the circle. However, the server quality of the game is way below average compared to the scale and all the success that the game is currently having. Fixing the bugs is one other thing but I think it is as important for the dev. team to provide better servers for the players first as it is hell to play a really intense fps game with over 100 pings that spike when an enemy is standing idly in front of your face.8 out of 10.

For PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, it didn't take me long on whether I enjoyed this game or not. I do enjoy my fair share of battle royale game, The Culling (before the terrible patches) was enjoyable, Arma 3 BR was awesome, and H1Z1 BR was also great. This game tries to bring these set pieces to the next level, and it horribly fails. The optimization in this game makes it unplayable at times. I understand that its a working process, but my god this game is unplayable at times. The customization is actually really cool, but if you don't get a viechle the game can turn out to be a running simulator. It kinda depends, some landings you can have a fun instense gun fight (if the game doesn't break down) or you can be running around, just looking for loot or someone to fight. Also for me it can get tiring pretty fast, and for a BR game it actually is kinda predictable. Half of the time you get shot by some dude camping or you get a couple of kills and have your car tip over for no reason and kill you. Overall this game is 3/10. It is below average, and I suggest to wait till the game is complete to play it."

As of this review and the update that dropped only a few days ago, I can finally run this at 4k on my two R9 390s. BF1, Titanfall, Destiny 2, Rust, Rocket league, Insurgency, Dying light and Prey, just to name a few all run at 4k at high-ish settings at 60 or so fps fine for me. As a game that has this much support and still has this ?????????????????? of graphics, it's pretty sad to see it stutter and frame drop as much as it does. That would be liveable on its own, but that combined with clunky movement, minor server lag STILL, and other stupid annoyances makes it almost a chore to play.

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,72,1,1,147,"17 August, 2018","What I would consider one of the best Battle Royal games if you're looking too play seriously, and don't want to deal with building mechanics and similar gimmicks. Somewhat buggy, especially on the miramar map, but I find it in no way makes the game awful. This game is great to play with squads as this game heavily relies on teamwork, but solo is fun in itself as it consists of small 1 on 1 skirmishes and I find is good for practice and training. One of my strong negative points is the loot boxes, which most require a $10 key to open, in a game that already costs nearly $40 having a lootbox system that requires money makes the company seem greedy. Luckily these loot boxes don't have strong impact ahead of looks, so it's passable. What I hate most about this game is that there is no server lock, meaning people from other serves, like the asian or european servers, can join the North American server. This doesn't seem like an issue except these people abuse ping, lag out games, hack a heavy amount and don't speak english in a team based game. Luckily this game is in a state called ""Fix PUBG"" where the developers are fixing stuff like this, so hopefully these two major problems will be fixed sometime soon. Even with these two negative points I would recommend this game, but it needs fixing."

This game cannot maintain a steady framerate, nearly regardless of the system on which it is running. Modern games that have been released since are more graphically demanding and run better, and it is abundantly clear that the publisher is more concerned with releasing additional paid content (like the mobile app) than fixing the issues that have been present since day one."

The developer is trying, so we'll see if it works out some of the kinks that need to be worked out. Cheating has dropped a bit, but still has room for improvement. De-sync is still an issue, but varies on when you see it. A true region lock could be a little better than just pings, but they won't do that yet. Ideally one where unless you're in a mixed group, you can't play out of your zone. That way it adds some accountability. Pros include not being Fortnight. More ""realistic"" in the sense of what they have for weapons and choices. Overall, over a thousand hours on it and love it. I don't care for all the locked crates and such they push out, but that's on other people if they want to unlock those. I still try to get friends to download and play this game. It's a great group activity with a few friends."

578080,2,0,Inventory3,666,13,1,184.3,"16 August, 2018","I honestly feel that this is the best battle royale style game on the market. While their questionable decisions with the season pass situation and the issue with servers and hackers at times can be pretty rough, the game as a whole is really enjoyable.When it comes to battle royale games on the market currently, most seem to be rather cartoony or very far from any realism, to a level where I can't really enjoy the game. PUBG seems to find that good place in the middle for me. While it isn't full on simulation, the gunplay and overall fluidity of the game is top notch. The gunplay is tight and actually changes from weapon to weapon, unlike many other games out there. The character customization is a nice plus too; I like the fact that we get to do, what I like to call, 'play Barbie' before loading into a match to stomp some people. There is a nice variety of clothing to choose from and with them partnering with twitch to have Twitch crates, our options are getting even better. We even get to choose weapon and parachute skins and while many people don't see this as an added selling point, I personally do.Overall, the game is a good time, especially if you have a group of friends to play with regularly. I'd recommend the game to anyone in search of fun battle royale gameplay with intuitive mechanics to really keep you on your toes."

578080,3,0,Helpisnice,132,6,1,461,"16 August, 2018","This game has a huge playerbase where MILLIONS are playing at once, with that being said there are a ton of reviews and from the looks of it as of mid august the game is rated mostly negative. Most of the bad reviews I've read are people who say the game is unstable or that they are being killed by hackers. When people say the game is unstable I really want to believe it is just their computer, when people play most games they want the most beautiful graphics so they put the game on ultra settings, and on the pubg steam store page they give you details on minimum and recommended computer specs to play the game. I kinda feel like all the people that say the game is unstable (Long loading times, Network lag, frame rate) are some of the people that think that if they have the minimum computer specs to play the game that the game should play on ultra. Pubg has some great graphics and can run on most computers but you should also consider that not all computers should be running on ultra. When it comes down to hackers, yes there are some proven hackers and PUBG is doing a great job to get rid of them but in all 400+ hours of this game I have ever played (played for over a year now) I can say that there has been a few people who killed me and seemed slightly suspicous and in that case I reported them for suspicous activity but I have also noticed that whatever hack they do (unless it's like a god mode hack, but i haven't ever come across that) that the hack usually isn't as threatening as most people think. Before things get to far I do wanna say that this game should fix the hacker problem but that most of the time killing a hacker would be the same as killing any other player, and even then coming across a hacker (in my experience) is very rare, I don't have numbers off the top of my head but I would confidentily say that every 1 out of 100 matches you player there is a hacker you most likely confront. Overall though I highly recommend this game if you like any other shooters or the literal hand shaking thrill in the top 2. Just make sure your computers performance matches with the configurations of the games video settings and that coming across hackers isn't as common as most people say."

Have to say yes there Money grabbing with this feature. might as well not put points in the game just earn a crate at the end of the match or just have a store where  if ppl wanna buy a box just buy a box, the point system is just redundent now.GAME MODESbase game is fine, but now they have added custom game modes and it now takes 5 -10 mins (even tho it give us an estimate time to matchmake, personally i think the custom game modes have killed the base game and ppl end up leavingthe lobby, even when you do get a game your lucky to get 80 - 85 ppl now.Optimization is a given, and server optimazation how about more incentive to win the match other than more points, how about win the match get a crate key or 2, or just a random piece of clothing or gun skins.these are just afew bug bares of mine, other than the game dying right now cause of the custom game mode, i think the base game is great."

578080,1,0,puddlez69,75,2,-1,394.7,"16 August, 2018","Okay, I am not one for writing reviews, but after playing 1300+ hours of this game since it's first conception until the latest map, I think I can objectively summarize my experience with PUBG. I came over to PUBG after getting hyped up for these battle royal games such as king of the kill and the Arma mod. I spent a long time playing games like DayZ Epoch Mod for Arma 2 and the only thing that excited me more than that was an arena based shooter where one instant it could be calm, and the next things are jumping as two people are trying to take pot shots at you from afar and another guy is in the house in front of you camping and holding it down. I was hooked instantly. I played mostly solo (managed to get in to the top 200 NA at one point after 3 solo victories) but also loved duos. Groups weren't my forte, but I still enjoyed them with friends.PUBG is a great game. It's definitely worth noting though that it has it's flaws. A few weeks ago I uninstalled the game, to my dismay, since I have been playing Sea of Thieves since it's launch in March (which is a Sandbox game, totally opposite of PUBG) Which surprised me. I love(d) PUBG. When it first came it out was pretty balanced. the weapons, the map itself, the vehicles. Every game was different despite the repetitive nature, and the replayability was high. And it kept getting better. They added more features, did a few optimizations and fixed bugs that would sometimes break gameplay. That is not what brought this game down for me. For me, it was the net code. Not even so much the cheaters because I so rarely came across one in game (perhaps just luck) And also those horrible loot crates and paid events.. upon writing this review, the game just became free to play. It seems like a desperate last attempt to regain player base again since people have been in steady decline. I would still have paid $30 for this game again, I do not regret spending many hours playing this game, it's one of my favorite games of all time. But until Blue Hole gets their act together and focus on the actual net code I don't think I can bear coming back for no incentive except loot crates that take $2.50 Canadian for a useless cosmetic item that I probably already unlocked three times already.  I cannot reccomend this game in it's current state. There are better battle royal games now unfortunately."

Bugs, desync (caused by poor netcode), poor anti-cheat software, and the below average performance just litter this game has and will make you rage at times. And no, I don?€?t have bad internet (100+Mbps). You can sometimes spray a full mag right with your sights right at an enemy and just not kill them. Alternitavly, you could be in the end game just to be killed by a hacker halfway across the map, wasting 20 minutes of your time. The new ?€?Fix PUBG?€? is a step in the right direction but from what I?€?ve seen soo far, nothing has really been fixed that is major. The sounds, controls and graphics are all average.On the plus side, getting to the top 10 is very exciting, filling you with an adrenaline rush and playing with friends can be fun if the servers aren?€?t acting up that day. And getting that winner winner chicken dinner is a nice way to end that gaming session.The general gameplay is by nature, reliant on luck but skilled players can still consistently win. But the odds are always against you as you have to survive out of 100 players so don?€?t expect to win most of your games.The gun physics are different compared to most games. This game favors ADS (Aiming Down Sights) compared to using crosshairs. Just if you came from a game from Counter Strike like me, prepare to use this functionality a lot more frequently. There is also bullet drop and velocity which adds a whole new aspect to combat, especially long range combat and gives the game a higher skill ceiling.An addition to the main game I would like to see is maybe a sandbox mode or something to help improve predicting bullet drop/ velocity at range.To conclude, if you want this game really bad or have friends that play this game hardcore, buy it. You will have lots of fun. Just know that you will experience a bunch of glitches and bugs that can ruin your experience. But to the unsure buyer or the one who is looking to buy their next game but doesn?€?t have lots of money to spend, skip this game for now. If the devs do however, fix all their major problems with this game, I am willing to change my review but I don?€?t see that happening anytime soon. Just make this game worth the money please."

The battle royale genre is boring, with many matches feeling the same as the last. In terms of the game itself, the quality is very questionable. It feels clunky and very janky. The matches last too long in my opinion, making solo games utterly lacking in action. Playing with friends was good fun, but with most friends leaving this genre, it is hard to find anyone who wants to play who are not competitive and just want to have fun.Most of the time I play this game now, I find myself to be frustrated, winning is no longer satisfying, getting killed by someone even so they were not even aiming at you destroyed my tolerance to this game. The devs have done a good job at bringing in more and more content into this game, at which I can applaud them for. But with much of the content being held within a loot box is just dragging me down. It takes a lot of games (most taking about half an hour to complete) just to get one loot box, with the ingame price to open one up increasing after being one. I am not motivated by this system to get the credits, to open the boxes. It doesn't make sense to work to get a piece of clothing which looks awful. The main way to get something which actually looks decent you will need to spend actual money. I lost interest in this kind of system after playing csgo. I don't see a point in playing this game anymore.If you like the genre, I would suggest you do more research on this game before deciding to buy it. I mainly stopped because I am tired of the gameplay, but who knows, the game could be good for you."

And after some time upgrading my pc i notice. Holy??????????????????its not my pc its this freaking game. Loading into game hearing tons of footstps and the plane flying but just the loading menu there for 5 to 10 minutes.. lagging all the way to kingdom come even though my pc is actually good better then before i might say. Not only me but my friends too sudden DC and crash game, Bullets dont register, move back into cover and somehow the enemy still hits u in the head cause the servers are amazing, hackers to ruin the game but yet my buddies and I still play this game cause we enjoy it. Our luck in this game is not so good we get s*** starts and things dont load plus we dont really win most of the time but we still ave fun. Now that the latest updates FIX PUBG and all have come... wow its still the same. i think ive unistall and reinstall Pubg like 6 times already but i still get crashes randomly s*** fps in game somehow parachutes?? dont start with that still lag in the air.

This game has the potential to be the absolute perfect battle royal it should be. Being a person for Australia i can no longer play OC server due to the game dying, I have to play SEA servers where there is nothing but desync due to people having AIDS internet or trash pc's.The guns are pretty perfect but when facing up against desync and a bunch of hackers it makes 30 mins a game pointless its like seeing the finish line then breaking your leg cause simply you might have the best gear but then all the sudden a game breaking mechanic like guns you will be holding will be tracing you from behind which people follow not only have the jump on you but will have a Anti-Recoil script ending your game with 10 people left. As angry as you can get i have held onto this game through its worst patches and greatest patches, praying that some day the devs would just fix the game to oblivion.This game i love to pieces i recommend anyone that loves adrenaline filled moments as the purest forms of it come out when grinding down to the last few people as rewarding as it is. You feel a sense of achivement. Until the devs fix there game and get the **** together will be discontinuing my journey of pubg as I have sat around for months waiting for this to be fixed.Simply the devs brought out maps to get hype and fans to run back to the game when it was knee deep in ****. I just hope bluehole can bring all of us back to the game we all love. <3 [LONG LIVE THE PUBG]"

It's insane. in the past day that I've played I'd say about 90% of my interactions have been with hackers--mostly people using gps or some weird bullet curving hack to land hits on me that aren't close to being inline with crosshairs. It's pretty impossible to play. And definitely something I do NOT want to spend money on, and I recommend that you do NOT spend money on it either. I'm in the process or a refund at the moment. Honestly, I think Steam should consider removing this from offered games. I doubt that will happen because I'm sure it's a huge money maker. And, just like Microsoft, Steam is a business. If they make money selling a b*llsh*t product then they'll sell it, regardless of customer opinion or satisfaction."

578080,0,0,girlish,474,12,1,159.2,"15 August, 2018","PUBG is a Multiplayer based game which involves you a player who will be dropped in to a land by a plane with another 90+ players. You're main objective is simply be the LAST PLAYER ALIVE. Aside from all Battle Royale Games Genre this is is quite unique from others. Yes there all the game mode but each on is different style and gameplay. 1.Getting into the game.You'r gonna be in a plane along with many other players with you and have the choice to get out of the plane to drop any landmark you wish to go for a plan to commence. Once you dropped you'r first thing to do is FIND A GUN, Because there is a chance a player has landed next you and have to defend yourself from any danger ahead. First thing is rush to the nearest building that either may provide you with a gun or possibly small supplies which is helpful for any type of unexpected scenario. And remember luck determines on what the building is hiding a gun for you or might have nothing at all.2. Loot hunting.For a higher chance to survive you must grab any possible Medkits drinks/painkillers which is considered ESSENTIALS to porgress the game easier. And ofcourse having a gun is a MUST or whatelse you have a choice of rushing to the enemy bare hands. You can easier be bothered of looting every house you find since it can be a small waste of time or simple kill a person who has looted since most likely they have done the looting for you. And one more thing, The best place to every get loots that will EXTREMELY have HIGH VALUE to increase your situations tactically are Loot boxes that can be dropped from the plane after the game progresses with time. HOWEVER remember a dropped loot crate means MANY player will try to get it as well. And some will use it as some sort of bait. So better check the area for any suspicious Vehicle/bushes/buildings and mountains since they have an angle to snipe you.3.Equipment Value. Armours have levels of quality which how they absorb and levels reach from 1 - 3 and level 3 helmets are now ONLY can be optained by loot boxes. Guns however... sometimes can be a preference and so far the BEST/ MOST FAVORED gun is the m-416 since its considered as the BEST assualt rifle for all situations. Snipers are powerful in early games, but gets useless in the last final circle. and the game has attachments who helps to upgrade your guns and favour its gimmicks like recoil vertically or horizentally. Its your choice yo decide. Also it varies from sights from Red dot to x8 scopes even a 15x which is only for sniper rifles. so yeah.4. The circle. The circle is VERY IMPORTANT to keep up with, so always remember to watch the map from time to time to know where is the next circle to plan your next move. Because the game has something up its sleeves. Something called the RED ZONE. Once your in it FIND SHELTER is a must to survive the dropping bombs of death. and knowing the circle before your enemy will give you the advantage to think your time which is the BEST spot to hide and fire at will. Because if not. Your gonna die before you know it as the enemy will be in various spots which will most likely a death for you.btw don't player in asian servers cause Chinese hackers are always there to kill you. Stay in either EU or NA servers since there most likely away from hackers that will ruin your experience."

578080,1,0,axrandomxmoment,89,1,1,524.5,"14 August, 2018","Gameplay:The gameplay is just great, with the gunfights being where this game truly shines. Other aspects of gameplay like driving vehicles, parachuting, and looting are, for the most part, decent enough to not hamper the combat experience (assuming you don't encounter any bugs). The reality though is that there are several bugs and missing features, which can cause this game to oftentimes feel incomplete and unfinished. Despite all that, the core gameplay truly redeems PUBG's lack of polish. I'm not sure how they did it, but PUBG Corp managed to craft a very satisfying and addictive gunplay system. I think that's why there are still so many players that continue to come back to PUBG, despite all the issues it had/has. I myself am not a huge fan of shooters. I've played various Halo and CoD games throughout the years, and I usually enjoy them, but quickly get tired of them. For some reason, however, I've stuck with PUBG for longer than I have other shooters, and I think this is the reason why.Both weapons and weapon classes have their own unique advantages, disadvantages, and nuances. Assault rifles are great for mid range, while still being useful in long range and close combat scenarios. Sniper rifles and DMRs are the best at long range firefights and subpar in all other situations, but neither is objectively better than the other. SRs can drop players with a single headshot, but if miss you have to unscope and load the next round before firing again. On the other hand, DMRs need at least two shots to kill, but can fire a volley of bullets before needing to reload, all without ever having to unscope. Submachine guns are undoubtedly the best for close range combat, but mediocre at mid range. Shotguns... shotguns kind of suck. They aren't useless, but they're inconsistent and frankly untrustworthy. As with handguns, you only really use them at the very beginning of a match assuming you have no other options. Each weapon has its own unique recoil patterns, attachment slots, rate of fire, damage values, bullet velocity, bullet drop, bullet drag, and other properties. So no weapon is truly king, even within their own class. All this encourages player preference and expression with their weapon loadout, instead of mindlessly and mundanely having one weapon be better than all others. In fact, it adds depth to the game by allowing opportunities for counterplay. If I have an AR and I'm facing an enemy with a SR, my best strategy is to get up close, where I have the advantage. My opponent, however, should either prevent me from closing the gap or keep his distance from me. Both our options are broadened or limited by our positions on the map and the circle's position, which makes every enemy encounter unique and play almost like a game of chess. This is even true for the weapons that are only available from airdropped crates. True, they do have a significant advantage over the weapons that spawn on the map, but by no means is it impossible or even unlikely to defeat a player who has airdropped weapons using only map spawned weapons. At the same time, the game spurs players to experiment with new weapon loadouts and tactics, as what weapons you use and what strategies you employ are governed by whatever weapons you happen to find upon landing and from looting dead enemies. Now, weapon balance in this game is of course not perfect, but it is highly refined. On top of all this, the guns are just so fun to use. Whether it's running and gunning with a submachine gun, controlling the spray of an AR in full auto, or lining up a headshot with a sniper rifle, the experience is genuinely gratifying.Maps and Pacing:So the most recent map is by far the best of the three. Sanhok is so good, in fact, that it almost ruins the experience of playing on the other two maps, Erangle and Miramar.For instance, pacing for matches is quite poor on Erangel and Miramar. Assuming you hotdrop, you'll have an overabundance of enemies at the very start of the match. If you manage to survive the early-game, you'll be met with a mostly dull and uneventful mid-game, as you move from circle to circle encountering few enemies, if any. See, the majority of players will have died at the beginning of the match, and those who survive are usually spread too far apart. For the end-game, the action will pick back up again once the remaining players are forced into a small battleground, but once again that's assuming you make it that far. You can quite easily die in anticlimactic ways, like taking too much circle damage. Now, if you prefer to play more passively, to land somewhere alone and gear up in peace, these two maps actively punish you for doing so. Isolated compounds usually have poor loot, little to no vehicle spawns nearby, and are close to the edges of the map. All this means you better hope that the first circle spawns close to you, because otherwise you are already at a huge disadvantage. Even if you do make it to the circle, the early and mid-game will be almost entirely comprised of walking simulator gameplay with hardly any combat. So that means only 1/3 of the match will actually involve you firing your weapon, and that's assuming you win.Fortunately, the new map, Sanhok, fixes almost all of the problems the other two had. Instead of one or two places to hotdrop on the entire map, there are several, which means players will be spread out among them instead of concentrated all at a single location. This means that there are more enemies for you to encounter during the mid-game since less players die in the early-game, coupled with the fact that Sanhok is half the size of the other two maps so you are never far from a potential firefight. If you don't want to hotdrop, there are a wealth of isolated compounds with respectable loot. And since Sanhok is once again much smaller, you can almost always make it to the circle without a vehicle, no matter where it spawns. In the end though, this just means we are left with two mediocre maps and only one really good map. I hope that PUBG Corp will try to tweak Erangle and Miramar to bring them up to Sanhok's level, as well as not making the same mistakes when creating new maps in the future.Bugs and Features:So even after this game left early access, it was plagued with bugs that ranged from minor annoyances to game-breaking. To have a Chicken Dinner stolen from you by a bug that should've been squashed long before a 1.0 release is simply unacceptable. On top of that, sometimes horrible network latency would cause you to get shot behind cover or have an enemy teleport behind you. If not, the game would just crash on you. This is PUBG at its absolute worst. But the good news is that there has been progress. The worst bugs are being minimized, if not outright fixed. The game doesn't crash nearly as much as it use to (at least in my personal experience). And network performance has been improving, though I feel this aspect of the game still leaves much to be desired. None of this issues have been completely resolved, not by a long shot. But at the same time they're nowhere near as bad as they once where.I wish I could say the same for new features and game modes. To be fair, we have gotten some goodies, like how the devs recently opened up server browser to everyone, or how they added the flare gun, the new vehicles, and new weapons. Still, there has been no news on a shooting range, or area where you can just practice and familiarize yourself with the all weapons, which in my opinion is far more important. I would also aprreciate if PUBG Corp would allow us to see the networking statistics, like my ping to the server, the server's tick rate, packet loss percentage, and so on. These are just two things that the community has been asking for since the 1.0 release, but there are still no sign of them.(I reached the character limit for this review, so see the comment section for my conlusion.)"

Often times the only kills you get are, A- You sit in a house and someone stumbles in and immediatly gets sprayed by a splurge of 7.62's from your erect AKM. B- You see someone sitting behind a tree and melt them with steaming hot lead.          - The intresting gourmet pubg combat only REALLY takes place at 75-100 meters away, with each party having either a bush, rock, or a tree to shoot from.         -Vehicle physics are completely Bull**** with people getting killed by a car rolling .0001 mph.However, the biggest most glaring issue, is its hilariously bad progression system. Ok, say you just spent 27 minutes playing a full match of pubg, winning through skill and stratedgy. You excitedly return to the main menu to claim your spoils. Using the the 1200 coins the game awarded you, you purchase 2 randomized crates. Thinking of all the intresting colthing and skins you can get you attempt to open them. However the crates require 2.99 dollars to buy a COMPLETELY SEPERATE KEY. You are not deterred. You are not going to waste the 27 minutes of your life you spent in a video game. You pay 6 dollars. You open the case, and you eagerly await your prize! Ahh, could it be a bandana or gold weapon skin you could sell?. It shows your reward. A RED SHIRT. 1 COMMON RED SHIRT. \     -See? This is what the game pulls ALL. THE. TIME. Or you could spend 8 bucks on the games insulting ""Sanhok Pass"" Which is a shameless and poorly done ripoff of Fortnite-Battle Royales ""Battle Pass"". (No I'm not just trying promote fortnite)Conclusion- Though their are many thrills to be found near the end, to much crap happens to get their. Plus you are rewarded with goodwill clearance items when you do! I would not recommend this game."

All of these issues have persited since *before* launch, but somehow the devs thought it was more important to make cosmetics, an adroid app, and push it as an esport before actually making it playable. This game should never be an esport in the best of conditions, especially in this state.

Overall the gameplay is smooth(er) but the gunplay and emersion is by far its best qualities. On the other hand there is a blatant slap in the face of the player and a total emersion killer. The exhaust sounds of the vehicles are completly and noticably wrong. There is no way that a car, stuck in a post human interaction era, could possibly have the sound of a well maintained machine. It seems that there is an abnormal amount of care for an ""abandoned island"" forcing you to question as to if you're truly alone. Random rust and weather (when its in the game) would cause random wear on said exhaust causing different sounds from each vehicle.

The loot box system is also a complete rip off for a game that you already paid for.Nothing in the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign website even aims at addressing the real problems with the game, it barely extends beyond bug fixes that most developers simply list in their patch notes after the fact. It comes off as nothing but a ploy to attempt to give the community false hope so they can milk the players just a little longer.The most blatant sign of their skewed mentality was when they decided to make that poor attempt at suing the Fortnite developers, instead of actually competing by making their own game better.They should be absolutely worshipping the streamers that have maintained interest in this game for them."

While the game has come a long way in terms of content and fixes since release, it has hit a wall of unbearable and has clearly been surpassed by Fortnite. There are they typical gripes you see all over the place (framerates, rendering, ping, server issues, etc....) but the worst thing has to be there is no sense of progression of accomplishment. Sure, if you win a match you get a nice ""WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!"" and a sizable amount of BP tokens. But your only option is to spend those tokens on crates, which is layers upon layers of gamble. It is randomized what crate you will receive, and further a random loot drop out of that crate. But worst of all, is now so many loot crates are LOCKED by a micro-transaction key! So not only are you paying to play the game in the first place, but if you want to unlock anything for the crate you earned you must spend more money. I can get games having a micro transaction system, it adds revenue that can be used to better the game, but when you make it a requirement to get nearly anything you earn and add that it is a random drop as well there is officially no point to play other than do your best to win and end up dying and earning squat for points. This was the standard for battle royal gameplay but has sadly taken a major downward spiral and is no longer worth playing. I do not recommend this game, even if on sale. Just go play Fortnite if you want a Battle Royal experience. At least its free and you can earn your goodies, or at least if you buy them you know what you are getting."

PUBG gives you one measly life for each 20-30 minutes of waiting and looting and in my case killing many opponents only for my time and effort to be wasted by some stupid desync. It's a great idea that is being trashed by Bluehole and PUBG Corp and I urge you to stop supporting them because it seems money is the only thing they will do anything for and if they stop getting the money they want maybe I will see a small amount of the $40 I bought this game for put to use.

It was in Early Acess so we could forgive the faults of the Unreal Engine until then. PUBG was going places and everyone knew it. The game was going to come out early next year with the promise of a new, bigger map. The devs kept pushing the bug fixing more and more on the backburner and the players became increasingly worried about the state of the game. When cars still experienced round ending glitches and players would crash at seemingly random points during the game, it seemed like PUBG was going in the wrong direction for its playerbase.I still kept going at it in the hope that the bugs would magically fade into the background of my play experience. They did not. This was just not a finished game, let alone an esports game. This game is a great concept made for a wide audience that could have been the next CS:GO but the devs have done absolutely nothing to fix their game. Almost nine months after this game was announced as being finished, it is still a broken mess. There just isn't anything fun about the clunky mechanics of this game.The devs even had the nerve to add an 'Event Pass' on top of a thirty dollar game just to rake in that last dollar. That move was it for me and I stopped playing entirely. Everything from the Chinese filled NA servers to the broken mechanics of driving have had little to no progress made in trying to fix them. 'Fix PUBG' is too late, and the devs know it. Don't waste your money on this and play another battle royale with competent devs and more polish."

578080,3,0,7.65612E+16,21,1,1,326.8,"12 August, 2018","Listen, if you've read many of the negative reviews on steam, you'll realize that quite a few have 100+ hours on PUBG. No one spends 100+ hours on a bad game. Furthermore, the negative reviews tend to rant more about the company bluehole (blueballs), and not the game, so ultimately, I think that most of the reviews should be positve, but blueballs is ????????????ing garbage. No moving on to my opinion of the game, not the company.          This game is honestly a modern classic, and witht he recent announcement by bluehole to ""Fix PUBG"", I think that by October of this year, this game will turn around from being hated, to being a steam favorite.       Let's start with solos. Solos in this game, are a bit hot or miss. On one hand, the tension of a 1v1 or top 10 situation is amazing, yet on the other, if you don't know the hot drops or player movement solos can be a boring experience where you run into no one for 15 plus minutes. So ultimately solos aer OK if you are willing to either hot drop, or you know player movement so you can hunt people down, and force yourself into fights.     For the next section, i'm going to focus on both duos and squads because they both share many similarities. Duos and Squads is where the game really shines, especially with friends. there is enough downtime, in which can converse with you friends, especially in squads, yet there is enough where it is stil an enjoyable experience. The gun fights are even more tense with a 4-man fight truly feeling like a war zone, you have to cover your teamates, help yourself, revive teammates, and take down the enem of course. This is honeslty, where PUBG shines.     Now to the negatives of the game, not blueball's negatives. The first downside, and idk if this is really a negative, is the monsterous learning curve. This game takes so long to learn and with server issues, which I will touch on later, the game can be very frustrating to 0 IQ individual (noob). Secondly, the game has sub par performance on low end PCs. I have a 1050ti and an i5 6500, which should be decent for this game, and it kinda is. The only real performance problems I have are occasionally the game will fail to render building before I land, the only exception being when I drop at Pecado and Hacienda on Miramar (The Desert Map), I almost always never have the buidlings renderred before I land. I run the game on medium-very low on all the settings. The last real problem, is the servers in this game, supposedly patch 19 made the servers run at a somewhat-stable 60hz, yet I still face hitreg, desync, lag, and the ""Network Lag Detected"" error. This is exacerbated by my low to mid range PC, where I feel like 1/2 bullets I land, when spraying, are actually registering. When single firing, the hitreg seems to be fine.           With all that being said, the ""Fix PUBG"" campaign blueballs recently announced, aims to fix performance and server issues, and I have faith in blueballs because if they don't COD Battle Royale and BF5 Battle Royale will kill this game in mere seconds. Blueball's entire game lies on ""Fix PUBG"", and they need to succeed. ?????????????????????????????€?????€??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????€?????????????????????????????????????????€???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????€??€??€??€??????????????????????????????????????€??€??€??€??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????€???????????€??€????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????You have been visited by the Fedora of Atheism and Autism!

It took a couple months and a lot fo troubleshooting on their end, but the game is now working again for me. The support staff were always friendly even when I was growing frustrated and irate. They constantly kept my ticket up to date while they were working on it. I am also not the most knowledgable when it comes to computers and everyone of their suggestions came with a step by step guide on how to do or give them what they needed.

If you have a low or mid range PC you are at a serious disadvantage because the game is so unoptimized the framerate drops to single digits when you get into a conflict. That takes all the fun from the game. The game goes like this: Loot -> Camp -> Loot -> Camp -> Loot ->Camp. A new player with a high-end PC using a pistol can kill you even when you have full lvl 3 gear and best guns. That's how unoptimized the game is. And that's not the only boring part. The most boring part is, there is nothing else to do. A full price game that only has two huge and one middle sized map and nothing else to do other than loot, camp, shoot and die. I have this game for two or three months and I only played for 17 hours and most of them was on the first week. I would refund it if I could. I bought this game from the peer pressure and I didn't enjoy a single second of it."

You get a buzz you dont get in any other game. Maybe thats why I keep coming back to it.However I must warn you - the fustration and dissapointment far outweigh the good. For a competitive online shooter the poor netcode/server lag/dysync completely ruin the experience. You will spend countless moments questioning what has just happened. How you got hit/how your shot didnt register etc etc. It totally breaks the game to the point I cannot recommend it.I'm waiting on a different game from a triple A developer who can give it the justice this genre deserves... and no thats not Fortnite.

578080,1,0,frazerb,240,7,1,416.1,"12 August, 2018",Pubg is my favourite battle royale game on the market. First I should mention that my forst experience with battle royale was around 4 years ago with Playeruknowns battle royale mod for Arma 3. PUBG is a great game alone or with friends. Yes it can be buggy at times and infuriating but it tactile and realistic feel is what makes me enjoy the game rather than its competitor fortnite. With the Fix Pubg campaign that Pubg Corp are running I am hopeful this game can regain its playerbase and be a competitively viable game. Its recent release of Sanhok has demonstrated that the devs know what the players like about the game and the faster paced gameplay makes it hard to go back to the older maps. Overall I would rate the game a 8/10 and will stick with the game throughout its development.

The foundational concept was really strong and interesting, but somehow the developers managed to be the most money-hungry narrow-minded failures possible and have just about completely killed the game. The amount of sheer money-grubbing garbage in this game is incredible. Rather than fix any of the extremely obvious issues the game has, they repeatedly add more and more pointless stuff aimed at squeezing more money out of the player base, for no real return on the players' side. Collecting cosmetic items is the only real progression system in the game, and you can only earn them through random reward crates. More often than not you'll receive a locked crate that requires a $2.50 key to open, and the rest of the time you'll probably get a duplicate of something you already have.These are the greediest most ignorant game developers I've ever seen. Don't buy this game. They don't deserve your money."

The major one is the number of servers and their maintainance, the servers of this game are very poor and are not present in most parts of the world due to which we've to play in far away servers which results in high ping issues, and the cherry on the top are the cheaters. After all the circumstances given when you finally start to like this game the devs will bless you with an update which will completely ???????????? up the game so bad that it becomes unplayable. For instance, the latest UPDATE #22 on the live servers introduced rank system and region lock, not to mention more bugs. Rank system is fine with me but region lock is a curse on the fair players who are living in Asia region beacause CHINA is the homeland of cheaters and unfortunately it lies in asia and due to region lock they(cheaters) end up playing in SEA and AS servers and in almost every single ????????????ing game skilled players die to those cheaters. They claim to have improved the anti-cheat system but unfortunately it isn't enough and i don't think that it's gonna be any better.Honestly, in my opinion this is the best BR game out there(ya, even better than Fortnite), it just need better developers.I still play this game because i'm addicted to this ????????????ing piece of trash(becuz it's the first multiplayer game that i ever played) but i recommend you not to buy this game if you don't wanna curse yourself for getting addicted to this ?????????????????? as ???????????? game."

And then it refused to get better, just worse... It HAD sharp visuals, amazing gunplay and a concept that had never been done to this extend. But now. The game looks like absolute mud. Apparently these developers are too stupid to actually optimize the game and gave it a taste of 2006 instead, Its blurry, bland and looks like a unity game, whilst still running like absolute garbage. On top of that. the game should be free. with how much you are paying for those random crates(wich almost always give duplicates) with how little BP you earn is simply disgusting. No sense of accomplishment, even when you are in the top 3 or when you win.

578080,0,0,cultavix,132,9,1,487.2,"23 October, 2018","Intro Where to begin. I've been playing PUBG since the day it came out, I didn't pre-order, which of course I regret every single day, since I bought it literally, a few hours after it was available for Order, rather than pre-order. Playability/Graphics/Smoothness The game has come a VERY long way, it's now very smooth, at least on fairly high-end setups. I've played the game on a variety of Graphics cards and CPU's 1060, 1070, 1080, 1080 Ti and 1080 Ti's x2 in SLI mode. CPUS: i7 6700K OC'd at 4.8Ghz, i7 8700k also at 4.8Ghz (pesky 5Ghz, I can't get it to run at stable speeds :( ) Back to the subject, with these setups, I've been able to get frames of up to 130-140 FPS, in the past 4-6 months, I don't think I ever drop below 100 FPS, under any circumstance, with settings which are mostly set to Ultra/other than effects and shadows, which I've got set to either low or med. The guns feel very realistic. GUI/UI So this is a tough one. I think for a game this huge, maybe it's not as huge as it once was and it could even be on the decline, it has a pretty mediocre UI, that's being fairly kind here. They could add the following: A) Allow you to tag buildings/positions of enemies/trees/whatever the hell you want, so that you don't have to shout to your squadmates ""behind you!"" or ""to the left of the green building"" or ""174!"" - Which 90% are completely meaningless or by the time you figiure it out, you are dead or they are gone.B) Allow you to place a marker on the map, which is visible to your squad-mates, in 3D, like in Fortnite, basically, so you dont have to use the minimap in anyway. Perhaps this hasn't been done for a legitimate reason, like realism? I don't know, but I'd personally love to have this. Surely, if we were Navy Seals, we would have some kind of way to know where we are parashooting into, with some kind of smoke which only we can see, etc.C) Re-design the front-page/shop. It's far to laggy, clunky and it just feels like a very poorly written game, from the very start, it's nothing like COD, BF, Fornite, LOL, Any Blizzard game, basically, any other great game out there right now.D) Give us more information in the GUI, for example, how far a team-mate is from you, in meters, when you are looking toward them. This is a tiny little recommendation. I'm sure many other people could come up with far better suggestions. Sound Now this is a VERY important aspect of any combat game, especially, FPS games, and when you are for example, doing a 1-v-1 in a building, or you are simply hiding in the bushes... I don't know, but I don't always feel like I get a sense for where people are coming from. I'm using high-end 7.1 Gaming headsets, the latest Corsair Void 7.1 and also the Logitech 7.1 cabled one, I don't know exactly which model, but it's a good one, I've also just tried good stereo headphones. I'm still not sure 7.1 makes any difference at all. The sound quality for the shots, can be pretty terrible on some guns, like the M15. Does it really sound like that in real-life? Some of the silenced shots sound pretty sweet... so it really depends on the gun.  Re-Playability  For me personally, it's about having a group of friends who are willing to play with you on a regular basis. If you have that, this game is extremely fun. With the release of COD: Blackout, I've yet to compare, as I've not had the chance to play COD:Blackout with a group of friends as I can't seem to find any friend who play COD:Blackout, they play Zombies or Multi... which really surprised me. Anyway.  In Summary... PUBG is a great-game which I'll forever hold dear, as the best Battle Royale game that was ever made, up until this point. Perhaps after I play COD: Blackout enough with friends, I will update this review... that game is highly polished, the gun-play is amazing and most of the aspects I described above, are addressed in this game, though not all."

Now, I want to know... what the hell is the point of playing and earning BP if you can't use the BP to buy keys?Since realeased, I have gotten about 8 crates (I don't often have time to play, so I don't play this game as much) that are just sitting there in my inventory asking me to pay money to unlock them, even though I already played to get the BP to even get the damn things. What the hell is that? There should be an option that let's you use your BP to either buy keys (I feel like 1000 BP each is reasonable) or to use BP to buy ONLY the free crates. Why am I bothering collecting my damn points for if I have to spend over 5000 of them to then not even get something for the time I've already put into the game?

You'll still see cheaters, bot spammers, random physics glitches and servers that are often just not up to the task of hosting smooth games.Not that regional servers really differ, you'll be playing against a mostly Chinese player base regardless of which region you play on, seeing as Fortnite took most the NA and EU players.I loved this game for the potential it had, but after almost 1000 hours of play over 2 years, I've seen none of it developed.Instead all development time went to lacklustre cosmetics and loot crates to maximise the profit margin without actually improving their game. The new 'Fix PUBG' campaign is a laughable admission from the developers that they've been pushing a broken product all this time, but at least it's good to know enough players left to the point that they are now forced to start addressing issues that all exist within the code of the game itself.The core idea and bullet physics are fun, but everything else has needed serious work for so long, that it's beyond the point of mattering. The player base peaked long ago, it's doubtful the numbers will ever come close to that again after literally losing half to a more popular title.The glory days are over, if they ever happened at all."

Don't get this game, just greedy devs who care way more about money than making a good game.

But you know how the old saying goes, if you can't beat 'em, try and sue the hell out of them out of spite.When PUBG came out it was the big head honcho of BR games, almost instantly dethroning H1 as the go-to BR game. And if I'm going to be honest, it was actually pretty fun for the first few hours. However it wasn't without faults. It uses Battle-eye anticheat, which is about as effective as using a window screen to filter water. So there's random hackers everywhere. Bullet hit-registration (hit-reg) is wonky at best, having shot someone in the leg (with included blood-splatter) only to have not even actually hit them at all. You can crash into a tree or a drop crate with a car and kill whoever's on the other side because the game de-synches so badly. Shotgun pellet spread is so horrendous that you should just leave the game if that's all you can find. Landing fights, while still a complete crapshoot, are more balanced than fortnite's. In fortnite all weapons have set damage and specs based on rarity, meaning if that ????????????????????? across the street finds a rifle and all you have is a grey pistol, you may as well disconnect. In PUBG however, unless that person manages to find a helmet or body armor, you actually stand a chance if you find a beretta and they have an M4. The PUBG devs are incompetent tools. They'd rather sue someone over ""taking their idea"" than they would implement more original content into their own game. This isn't the name you want for a company, but it's the one they have now. Then they have the nerve to attempt and copy Fortnite's ""battle pass"" system with none of the rewards or incentives then wonder why noboby bought it. I'm not a Fortnite fanboy by any means, I haven't even touched the game since season 4, but as it stands as the one of the only 3 BR games its really the only comparison to quality standards I can make. Fortnite is free, unique, and most importantly,??????????????????actually works. If Bluehole would just take the time to fix everything instead of adding new outfits, crates, keys, maps, and a 9 gigabyte update every week, I'm certain that PUBG can become an exceptional game.There's an actual adage that goes ""Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners"" and that's exactly whats happening between Fortnite and PUBG, Bluehole is so focused on the numbers that fortnite is taking from them that they're more concerned about trying to kill the competition than actually improving their own player experience. Until they pull their collective heads out of their asses, my review will stay negative."

The aiming mechanics are god awful, the accuracy is deeply nerfed and unless the enemy is in front of you , you will only hit some lucky shots. The tracking mechanic is the worst that I saw ever, even when you see the replay of your death, you see that the enemy aims behind your caracter, meaning that your movement has GOD DAMN LATENCY! Like if you had 1000 ping, but only upplied to your position. And don't ask about optimisation, as it is the worst you'll ever see. I have a Lenovo Legion laptop, which plays AAA titles smoothly, but this crapload laggs and freezes on the worst settings possible. And instead of making the aiming simple like in cs go (your crosshair just follows your pointer) they made it so it is always a few pixels behind, making the spray control f***ing impossible for people who don't spend their life playing this. The developers overcomplicated the??????????????????out of this game for literally no reason, and made a terrible game in general, but instead of fixing things they just keep dropping some new unneeded garbage in, like new scopes and a few copypaste weapons, along with adding 2 crappy maps , and removing map selecion.

578080,1,0,pupper_,91,8,-1,545,"9 August, 2018","Not recommended. The game is very broken, in almost every component of gameplay. From initial drops and parachute accuracy, to looting fluidity and loot balance, to the most important aspect: gunplay. You will routinely crash or freeze, have memory leaks, disconnects, and a slew of technical issues. You'll also find you often die behind cover, and you'll experience significant lag when fightning CQC. The ""fix pubg"" event is a joke, and it is disgraceful that a game so poorly optimized and unfinished is hosting e-sports events and milking the wave Dota started. Bottom line, if it worked, it'd be great. It doesn't work, and may never.Updating again: This is actually the most disgracefully made, poorly optimized, scam excuse of a game I've ever had the displeasure of trying to play."

Just for visualization: You could afford 11 fkin falcon 9 rockets with that money and still would have 10 mil left for I dont know icecream. Now keep visualizing this 11 falcon 9 rockets. How in Elon Musks name can it be that almost a year after release of the game, still the same bugs do occur as in early Beta?

I mean like how could a kid play this game without the ability to spend his fathers/mothers hard earned money for a fkin pink Mp9....

You can never expect a 100% perfectly polished game with no bugs at all, every game has its few problems and in this game there really are only few. I have around 700 hours in the game and through that entire expirience rarely am i killed by problems due to the game. The developers do listen and try hard to fix the problems that they put into the game. For 30.00 dollars you are getting ana amazing game with great gunplay. Only problem I have with it is that on the 8x by 8x maps the mid game seems to be a bit dry. But some people enjoy that and others don't, if you don't enjoy it choose the smaller map, that's why it is offered to you. The 4x by 4x map is the perfect size keeping the game fast paced and eventuful the entire time. Gamers complain way too much nowadays if something doesn't go their way in the development process all hell breaks loose. The game is just fine and I highly recommend it if you are looking to have a lot of intense fun  and competitive gaming with you're friends. BUY IT"

Notice that most of the people who left this game a negative review have 100s or even 1000s of hours on record. I don't know how you can not recommend a game that you spent that much time in.I bought this game for $30.00 back in early access when there was only 1 map. Since my purchase, the developers have added numerous new weapons, vehicles, and two entire new maps, all at no additional cost to me. Additionally, while I'm sure there are still plenty of people cheating, there are far less cheaters in the game now as opposed to at launch thanks to the developers anti-cheat efforts.The game does run better now than it did at launch, but for many it can still experience crashes. I run this game on my SSD with an i7 and a 1080 and I almost never have any problems running the game. I might crash 1 out of every 50 games.Overall, after logging over 300 hours into this game, and probably will get a couple hundred more over the next few years, I have to recommend this game. You will have fun as long as your set up can run the game."

You literally give up all your information playing this game.Said it wasn't going to do lootboxes while in early access but they still did it??? I remember!Not very optimizedHad a lot of cheaters, still some in game.The game is very pro anticonsumer. Updates for cosmetics/locked lootboxes most of the time, if not, all the time. First battlepass event was very anticonsumer. Most of the things that were good, were locked behind a paywall.Can only buy random lootboxes that's filled with locked lootboxes that you have to use a key for and you have to use real money to pay for the key.Bottomline, the game is actually fun to play. It is just, the game is so anticonsumer that I'd prefer to not play anymore. READ MORE BELOWAlso, a BattleEye message popped up once when I opened the game, it was talking a little bit about what they are doing with your information and that I should contact BattleEye if I have questions about it. I looked into it more because I didn't want to be apart of it.On BattleEye's site it says that they have access to see what you are running, your system, your documents, your information, and more while you have this game opened. You pretty much give up your information playing this game. I tried contacting BattleEye using their method to figure this out and how if I could opt out of it and if they could delete whatever information they had on me and they pretty much said they couldnt do anything and that I should contact the game publisher. They also said that if I were to talk about this to the publisher, that the publisher would probably ban me. Honestly, look at what they do for pubg on their site adn try to send them a message about it.So, I contacted Bluehole's support at the same time and they said that there was nothing that they could do either and that BattleEye is required to play and was in the game when it launched. He then later says that he could not delete my information if there were any. He then said that the only way to not have them getting your information means that you would essentially not even play the game. The thing is, is that in the document on the site, it says that you could not allow them to collect your information and more by just sending them an email. Anyway, there was one more email that I could have sent a message to, to try and talk about it, but it became apparent to me that none of these clowns know that they are doing and Bluehole is using your information and selling it for that sweet sweet korea money.Notice how lots of games have this in their game, because it is proven to work. Business wise, it is profitable for little to no work. Calls itself an anti cheater program but can do so much more. Makes you wonder how Digital Extremes deals with cheaters???"

To bugs and glitches.It's been a very mixed bag. Sometimes things are fixed only to be broken again a few updates later.The worst part is the game supposedly hit 1.0 on 21st of December. Yet it was clearly a rushed botched job. Because only now have the developer decided they want to ""Fix PUBG"" in a series of updates. So if you're interested.

578080,2,0,iitheklumps,168,13,-1,269.1,"9 August, 2018","Here's all I've got to say:1. I originally bought the game because it promised good mod support - they turned their backs on that promise.2. Brendan Greene, Lead Dev, claims that all custom servers will require a fee to run, stating that it's how he had to run his mods back in his Arma 3 days - Let alone that this game doesn't even allow real mod support, Arma 3 lets you run servers on your own hardware, you only paid to rent other people's servers. PUBG gives no choice but to rent a server.3. A heftily priced game which offers essentially one real mode - Yet has the audacity to charge for cosmetics, have made free means of gaining cosmetics absolutely insignificant, and now also charges for a sort of Season Pass which is blatantly derivative off that of Fortnite's; yet offers SIGNIFICANTLY less. Furthermore, Fortnite has a free version of their BattlePass which offers nearly as much as PUBG's. How bout that?4. Game still runs like???????????????5. To continue from point 3: The publishers have the audacity to attempt to sue other games for ""copying"" the Battle Royale mode, even though Game Modes should never be liable to copyright - Yet this, PUBG mimics so many of the other Royale modes: As mentioned, with Fortnite's Battle Pass, Emotes, the new spotting functionality, etc.6. And to continue from Point 5, the developers and publisher have so much audacity, as if it forgets that the game is virtually asset flip one. It doesn't hide the fact that many of its 3D models were bought from the Unreal Engine store - It makes you wonder how much more of the game was outsourced.7. The devs like to parade around how many hackers they've banned and the effort they put into keeping the game hacker-clean, yet it's mortifying how much this game is STILL plagued by hacking. Fanboys will parrot how ""it's not that frequent"", Hackers being noticeable in the first place is insufferable; I've yet to encounter a hacker in Fortnite and so many other shooters I used to play. But most importantly, you will have your game ruined by some hacker every 6 games. You can still argue that ""it's not a lot"" relatively, but it still ruins your day with the game.8. The game is infested with bugs like the pantry of a run-down restaurant in Eastern Belarus. Seriously, more often than not the game handicaps you being of some bug.People that defend this game religiously will claim I'm so Fortnite fanboy like I've seen so many times before - I've played my far share of Fortnite, I have about 40 hours in it compared to my 270h here; and I have to say, I used to prefer PUBG. I found it a lot more enjoyable. But, whilst I play neither now, I can only say Fortnite is an objectively better game and it does it for free. You know what, look beyond Fortnite, go to Realms Royale, go to the Darwin Project, Go to The Culling, even go to Ring Of Elysium! Because those games have polish and real originality that PUBG severely lacks. Not only is PUBG an absolute trainwreck, it's one that is commandeered by developers that give absolutely no??????????????????about the player experience or ethics."

The company ended up prioritsing cashing in on the game, by trying to release as much content as possible without double checking if it was release ready. This meant two new maps and multiple different platform ports before they decided it time to actually focus on fixing the game and optimizing it.  Even the Xbox version was unplayable with rendering being below 30 fps. Now after all this time, after the population hit approx 600k they decide to launch a ""lets fix the game guise"" campaign.

As the updates keep piling on, bugs keep popping up, and in higher numbers than before. Take for instance, the BattleEye update, drastic matchmaking times were an offspring of this update, as if the patchers aren't looking to the future.

Once his 15 minutes of fame were up and it was clear that he was not going to become a video game industry ""celebrity"" as he desired, he vanished with the hundreds of millions of dollars this game has made, and will continue to make through the loot boxes and cosmetics that Bluehole have focused on instead of getting this game out of early access. And yes, I specifically said that because despite being a 1.0 release since December, the game is very much still early access quality. HOPEFULLY it is not too late for PUBG as it was a pretty fun game when it worked properly, and Bluehole seems to have realized they need to do something, and fast, as PUBG is being dwarfed by competently-made games such as Fortnite. It's either that, or they go back to making terrible MMOs that nobody plays.As it stands, PUBG is a mess of a game that exists to serve the thrills of Chinese hackers, of which the American servers are abundant in (apparently locking each region to their own region would be racist). Bluehole refuse to do anything that may jeopardize their standing with the massive Chinese playerbase this game has, and we all know that the Chinese are not trustworthy (see: boiling dogs alive, refusal to maintain escalators and elevators resulting in gruesome deaths, Feng Shui, etc.)."

But i hope that they will fix some issues like y some weapons are not available in other maps and why not adding more weapons. This game needs these things to grow again.1 Add more weapons2 more animation i.e entring exiting vehicles, 3 player must have more knockout stances. 4 player must be able to drag his downed buddy to safety or also option to carry . 5 bullets should pass through thin / light materials. 6 night mode will be a plus with flashlight / laser attachments and NVGS.

Playing on 20 FPS for the past half year while meeting the corresponding system requirements speaks for itself. The game is horribly optimised, networking/netcode is joke, many features are not working properly or not at all (like the deathcam). Now PUBG Corp. started a campaign called ""Fix PUBG"". Firstly you have to download almost 10 GB for a single patch, which includes like 10 very small listed fixes/changes which is ridiculous to say the least. Updates in general are huge, changes are not noticeable. Yet again I hoped with this campaign this would change. Sounds promising I thought, so I started the game again. Well...the game crashed when i tried to change a T-Shirt in the main menu. Restartet the PC/Game, crashed again while loading the main menu. Remember the name of this campaign? I think the rest is self-explanatory.And the cherry on top of the cake? Weapon skins and clothing that cost hundreds of bucks while having awful designs and 10$ event passes that offer no valueable gameplay.Thank you for reading.Do not buy this game."

PUBG has the capabilities and potential to be one of the greatest if not the best game in history of gaming.But for this to happen, it must do one thing;Oceanic servers;Only reason I bring this up, is because people in Australia, New Zealand etc cannot find a game in Solo or Duo; Third or First person, and if we do get lucky enough to find a game, it's at least a 10 minute wait. Thus the reason why you see Oceanic players deciding to play Fortnite instead. At night time between 6pm and 10pm AEST is the only time we can find Squad games in First Person within 10 seconds. But what's that telling us? It's telling us that Oceanic players will either avoid playing PUBG until night time, or they say it's a total waste of time and decide to spend their time on another game like Fortnite for instance.There's rumours that PUBG is deleting the Oceania region completely, and I certainly hope these rumours are false. Oceania is a region in many games; League of Legends, Dota (1 and 2), CS:GO, Fortnite, Call of Duty and I'm sure there's plenty more games.All I ask is that you use your staff that are professionals in this area and fix the servers. There are so many people that want to play this game as much as possible. I stream PUBG on Twitch, I've spoken to many other Twitch Streamers from Australia too.. They all say the same thing;  The Oceanic region is broken in PUBG. Every other region is fine. Majority of us in Australia and New Zealand play on South East Asia Servers and find games within 2-3 seconds in any search. Sure we do get 150-170 ping, but it's purely because we want to play games and get better at the game, it's how we are showing our dedication and support for this game.Hopefully this gets a few likes and upvotes that can get this seen by the Administration department."

After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win!

It is scattered with ?????????????????????t crates, money making schemes, and they say the fix bugs and issues with the game, but what I have found is that they have only made the game worse, instead of optimizing it. And don't get me wrong, I have more than a powerful computer to run it, it just seems that it gets worse and worse as time goes by.

The game is extremely fun with friends. And even solo. Gun balancing and variety is okay. Maps are fun and diffrent. Mechanics are good but can be clunky from time to time. Oh and the hit-scan is suprisingly okay. But now for the important questions that people have:- The optimization is really??????????????????like people say. I say I have decent PC but its hard to get frames (I get 70-80). There are some settings to make it work but yeah its kinda bad. Its not unbearable though.- I played like 30 games or more. Didn't find a single hacker. Maybe I am lucky but I didn't see any.Developers are ignoring the fact that the optimization is?????????????????? If it gets fixed one day I think there is no problems with the game. I don't like cartoony games like fortnite and H1Z1 is dead so for me this is the best battle royale to buy out there. Don't be scared to buy it and give it a go.

This game has had a luxury life they've had more money and fame than MANY other games out there. And still they can't fix basic issues, fortnite on the other hand is run by a very hard working company and I know some people don't like the gameplay of fortnite. But the devs did everything right that PUBG did wrong. Weapons are reworked daily. desync and hit regestration is nearly perfect, and fixed content ( Is not super op (QBZ) and is also usable). I still suffer from alpha bugs today, the plane ""jumps"" halfway across the island then zips back making jumping at the right time much harder than it should be. I can't pickup weapons for almost 10 seconds because of desync. I lag forward and backwards making gun fights impossible to fight. I also see many negetive reviews that make VERY good points are found helpful by 100+ people. All in all it's cute to see PUBG on their knees begging for us to come back because while they were rich they were busy trying to get richer (trying to sue fortnite, constant release of crates, and payed skins) all they had to do was listen and fix bugs that should not have made it past beta.

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,33,1,-1,182.4,"7 August, 2018","Ultimately the problem with PUBG is there is no large advantage to skilled players.  If you go into a gun fight with a great player versus and ok player, within 100 feet, there is just about no real advantage to either player if they both have good tactics.  The only time I find an advantage is when someone finds a long range weapon with scopes, can properly spot players, and aim well with their mouse.  Even in those scenarios they still have to connect with a player with armor multiple times in which they can heal or run away by the time you connect enough shots.  With the problems with the code in the game, which is talked about constantly, you just can't have a ping, GPU, skill advantage.  You may as well roll the dice.  I have played the game about 180 hours, and I have probably watched streamers for about 1000 hours.  They have the exact same problems that I occur.  Even today with all the improvements the game has made in the last 1 1/2 years.  The newest comments the developers talk about are Client Performance, Server Performance, Anti-cheat, Matchmaking and bug fix.  The problem still stems from a game that isn't fully thought through about how they intend on making the game more about skill than about luck of the zone, hiding, RNG of finding the right loot, and getting that slight luck of who barely survived that gun fight that didn't include much skill."

However, PUBG is not without its flaws. The hit registration in this game is mediocre at best and desync ruins fair gunfights. As I played more, I began to notice more and more of flaws such as the awkward and clunky movement system, server lag, matchmaking times during lower-populated times of the day, and frequent server hiccups which can ruin combat situations for the unfortunate.

I know it sounds like an excuse, but seeing yourself shoot at an enemy and clearly land your shots just to die and see that no actual damage was done is ????????????ing infuriating. The list of flaws with this game is endless and I don't want to waste your time stating all of them here.Enough ranting about flaws, the game has lots of room for optimization and refining the game would only make it better. It is the refinement of the game that will make enjoyment increase tenfold which is why I see myself returning to the frequently updated popular battle royale game, Fortnite. What came to my surprise is the update released TODAY (August 7, 2018) which announced project ""Fix PUBG"". You honestly have to look at the announcement for yourself, but this gave me hope for the game I see massive potential in. The devs have finally responded to our calls and have decided to put some of their profits toward improving the game. If this doesn't get you excited, I don't know what will because the future of PUBG looks very very promising.In conclusion, I truely believe Bluehole will redeem itself and win back many players. When it comes to recommending the game, I say ???????????? IT just buy the game because why the ???????????? not? In its current state, PUBG is still loads of fun and the gameplay feels very unique. I am certain PUBG can only get better from this point on, just so long Blueballs follows through with Fix PUBG.TL;DRgame is fun, but has ?????????????????? performancegameplay and concepts are uniqueBlueballs finally recognizes the public and is now actively fixing their gameWould recommend"

But now the game is definetly playable. The hacker rate is down. If there is any I rarely see them. The problem now is that the servers are always ""too busy"". This happens more often than you would like to see. But as of now those are my only gripes and complaints. Also I do love the events that PUBG release. The sniper challenge and the .45  challenge are probably my all time favorite. I will say that if PUBG really values their customers they would be more like Fortnites devs. Ther are always pushing updates to make the gaming experience more pleasant. So for me. Its a hit or miss. Its definitely not for everyone."

I havent been playing this game a whole lot, but by watching videos, reading news about the game, and playing it myself, I think Its best if you leave this game alone. PUBG could be a good game, but the devs are focusing way much more on their mobile version of PUBG (which no one asked for) and then there also focusing their Xbox version way much more than the PC version. Then, PUBG corp is trying to make a sport out of this game, a unfinished game! PUBG has many bugs and glitches, and then not to mention the unplayable lag at times. Plus, the devs are extrememly, I mean over the top EA level greedy. Their stupid battle pass didint even allow players to keep the free items, instead you have to pay for the battle pass to actually keep the free items, or else there was a time limit on those items, and you'll eventually lose them, then to top it all off, they want you to pay 2 dollars for a damn key to open one of their crates, almost every crate needs a key, and some of the clothing in those crates are 0000.1% chance to get them, how do I know this? simple. I watched a youtube called TheActMan, explaining how this game basically steals your money, and dosent give you anything back. Look, I want to like this game, and it has great potential to be a decent battle royal game, but sadly the devs are slowly killing their game just like the h1z1 devs did. So for now im going to let this game go, and maybe try it again until the devs actually fix the damn game."

578080,1,0,oblikua,127,6,-1,485,"6 August, 2018","Well, my first negative review on Steam... This game had it all to be a great game, and it was at sometimes, and the gunplay is still one of the very best in shooting games. The core concept of the game is good, everyone knows about battle royale now, and this was the king.   Aside from all the weird stuff with Epic Games and Fortnite, the truth is that PUBG Corp (Bluehole Software) is running this game into the ground. From overloading the game with micro-transactions to not fixing the games' many bugs, everytime they patch something, they break something, they can't handle the problem with the cheaters, the optimization is still really poor, and finally, they bring a season pass for 9.99???, for a month of ""missions""( they were bugged to hell) with very little compensation (like skins and clothes, many of them temporary).    The end result, and for me the final ""nail in the coffin"", is the fact that as the player count goes down, the time which you spend waiting for the matchmaking goes up, a lot. In a game where RNG counts so much, and a bad landing can mean you only play for one minute before getting killed, having to wait more than 2 minutes for a match to start is a dealbreaker for many people.   Maybe when all the AAA titles like CoD and Battlefield come out with their takes on battle royale, they'll decide to fix this game...not very likely, and probably too late for that. :/"

Play Fortnite instead, or get one of those new battle royale games coming out of AAA studios.This game had so much potential, all wasted due to the lack of effort from the developers. Where do I even start? PUBG is full of game breaking bugs, Chinese hackers and to top it off the devs keep introducing new (not to mention useless), in-app transactions. This is the first PC game i've ever played to employ TEMPORARY PREMIUM COSMETICS; you pay real money for cosmetics that just expire after a period of time and have to be bought again.The battle pass introduced isn't worth it either. If only the devs could focus on fixing the game, there would be some chance of it being able to compete with the rest out there. Textures don't load till a couple of minutes into the game, even on hardware running at relatively higher specs. The game physics break hard and often. Cars go flying. Grenades go through walls. Recently there have been server desynch issues as well.Honestly, at this point i'm fairly convinced that Blue**** is only trying to milk the game to the last of its moments and has already given up on trying to save/salvage it. Hence, save your money and go get something else."

And it doesn't even have the qualities to justify these performances: the graphics, the models, the animations are all average at best, so it's not like it has to load some overcomplicated stuff.The movement is slow, both walking and aiming, it always feels like you're contantly moving through molasses; shooting feels like a dice roll, sometimes the shots register, sometimes they don't, CQC fights are a nightmare due to these factors.Even when it works, it has the alluring chance of you getting into an exciting gunfight or sniping a guy from a long distance, but these moments are rare, most of the time the fights are one-sided as you're dead before you even realize where the shots are coming from and the fights generally last less than a minute, the remaining 30+ minutes that you don't spend looting you spend running from point A to point B, hoping not to get sniped by a guy camping on a hill since the start of the game.I regret giving this game more than one chance; i cannot reccomend it unless you have friends to play with and are fine with potentially walking around for 30+ minutes only to get killed by things you had no control over. Even then try other battle royales that are FTP before spending 30??? on this.TLDR: Game is a mess, controls like??????????????????and is boring unless you have somebody to play with or are a masochist, try other FTP BR games before deciding to spend money on this."

But over the past few months i got very bored of it, and the content coming out wasn't sparking my interest.Would i recommend buying this game? Yes and no, Yes because it is a realistic shooter, and alot of players like myself love realism. No because of the price, and the content that the devs are producing, it just isn't tasteful and gets really stale even though the gun fights are amazing and alot of factors such as the vehicles, and the healing system gives it such a realistic feel  i'm still very Iffy on prefering this game over other games. Maybe if the price came down, yes but bascially 30 bucks for a game that has gone down the  drain isn't worth it, in its past days yes, but with all the other Battle Royales coming out and with the pre-exisiting game Fortnite that is skyrocketting in perfomance and player base and great content PUBG is struggling at the moment, and there reviews aren't getting any better, if you wanna try the game do so, YES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO STILL HAVE FUN ON THIS GAME it's still one of my favorite games on steam, just it got kinda boring and is in a rut will i come back to it? Yeah, some day but not too soon. So i do recommend Maybe trying it. who knows, maybe one day PUBG will make a return and smash the leaderboards for being one of the best shooters on steam as it stood previously, Over all i'd give this game a 6 or a 7 out of 10."

I decided to uninstall when I was top 5 and pushing to the circle when i saw a head pop up above a window sill in front of me. I stopped for 2 seconds to aim and shoot and i got sniped in the back of the head from someone who was camping in a building behind me. I dont know if it was always like this or if the meta for wins is just to camp, but regardless it just wasnt fun for me. Also the gameplay is so slow and feels unresponsive, it feels like it takes 3 seconds for a door to open after i hit F.

PUBG was the best battle royale experience in the beggining of 2017. Devs were doing lots of work to improve our experience and make sure we are all happy can enjoy this game. But after 1.0 realease Bluehole changed their priorities. They are not listening to the community at all. They are just serving us skins and pay-to-open-crates and trying to persuade us that PUBG will last longer than 5 years from today (06.08.2018). It won't if you will act like that, Bluehole. This game is losing it's player base. It's shrinking faster than blue zone on Miramar when you landed in a bad spot. There is no long-term plan for PUBG development. After months and monts we are getting ridiculous changes that should have been done soon after release and they are not done properly. There is no serious development plan for this game. PUBG gave popularity to battle-royale, but I hope it will die as quickly as It risen. RIP. I won't be back till devs change their ""customer approach"".Just don't buy it.

Other then those two times I have had no such bad luck with every game being full of cheaters but I guess I would feel that way if I was not good enough to win...."

I still play it occasionally because it`s in that area between realism and run`n`gun that I like. However the game is not evolving. Adding irrelevant stuff and bug fixing  won`t fix core issues (which should have been fixed in the success of early access).What is being done is just the bare minimum to make it seem that something is being done, to pump a couple of more months of life to the game before ditching it completely."

578080,1,0,zaphod2beeble,21,3,-1,110.4,"30 October, 2018","I was a big fan of this game when it came out. I played it even though i only loaded into he game when the plane was nearly finished flying. I played it despite the buildings only loading after a minute. I played it even though it crashed about every fith game or so. Despite that I would still have given it a positive review, even though it was buggy and generally just broken, it was still fun. It was rewarding.Just to make things clear, i hate hackers and just hacking in general. I find it not only unfair but disrespectful to other players and the games developers.So, with that out of the way i can explain why i can no longer recommend the game to anyone.I wanted to play the game again recently but there was a large update to the game and after an hour of steam not installing it i realised the hard drive pubg was on was full. So i uninstalled it, and installed it on another drive, which had plenty of space on it. When i finally got to playing the game i had fun. I got half way through a game and was enjoying myself with my friends when i was kicked out of the game with a message saying something along the lines of ""unknown files"" or something similar. I tried to reconnect but it wouldn't let me and so i died and my friends lost the game. By that point I had already spent multiple hours just trying to play a single game and to lose a great game like that was increadibly annoying and so i played a game that, while slightly buggy, is a superb game and quite honestly i recommend it, Battlefield 3. But anyway, fast forward to now. I check steam, i see i have a game ban in pubg. It states that the ban will not be removed and that i have violated the terms and services and intern have recieved a game ban. It also states that steam service cannot remove the ban and that the games own support must be contacted. An FAQ section answers the question by stating that no bans will be removed. Contacting support was unsuccessfull and so i guess i will not recieve any reply or help.So in conclusion i now not only can no longer play pubg, but i also now have a game ban on my profile, which will result in many problems with third party matchmaking services and similar.All of this just adds to the burning, stinking ship made of turd that pubg has become and results in me not recommending this game. It's awful, you'll have trouble running it if your pc isn't good. You'll have rounds ruined by bugs or crashes and then to top it all off, you'll get killed by an ACTUAL hacker, who bypasses the useless anticheat like its a closed gate with no fence around it.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS AWFUL.It's as simple as that. I'm jumping off this stupid game and fully hope there are either MASSIVE changes or this game completely dies and results in bankrupcy for its stupid developers."
578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,33,4,-1,97.6,"30 October, 2018","Where do I start with this game from the inbalance of weapons, to the lack of protection, to the boring maps etc. etc. just about everything about pubg is very obnoxious and boring. I'll start with the balancing I guess, while the game offers a wide variety of weapons and armor there are many and I mean many fatal flaws in how they did it. For one there is the armor durability system and while that may seem realistic at first and seem like it should be in the game it really should'nt, what the armor durability truly means for the game is that ones success in each round is even more fully dependent on the original luck of finding armor as even getting shot once or twice a level three vest may drop below the effectiveness of a level one which means you can never take armor from others. You may ask why cant you just find more armor or whatever or what does armor have to do with anything if you dont get shot but I will get to that now. for one armor is relatively rare especially at the very end where it can really only be found on others as the zone is too small for you to loot. The problem however with just never getting hit has nothing to do with skill however but instead is fully dependent on the prevalence of overpowered assault rifles and snipers in the game. Now I understand that assault rifles and whatnot have a higher caliber than a random submachine gun but the fact is the damage difference as well as the range of snipers in the game give the advantage to those who have no skill and instead choose to hide in bushes the entire round waiting to shoot at someone running from the zone. While these accusations may seem unfair I have seen better use of weapon balancing in surviv.io (a free .io game similar to pubg) in that game all weapons have fair balance to the point where you never truly have a huge advantage over another just because of your weapon. Instead relying on your ability to use effective cover and concentrate your shots. Any who have played surviv.io enough will agree with me that it is a ton more balanced not just because of the use of all sorts of different weapons for different strategies but because snipers aren't as incredibly overpowered as they are in pubg. When I talk about the lack of protection I am both talking about the vests as I mentioned before as well as the lack of actual buildings and natural cover in the landscape on all maps. In every map the most likely way to die is just walking through a random field because there is no other way to get into the zone. Overall a problem with Pubg is the lack of structures and obstructions that would both provide some sort of color and add intrigue to the map not just the small confined cities on the maps covering less than half of the overall area. All in all this game is definately not worth it and you would have better luck with most other games as the balancing is truly bad."

Somehow you can put 3 shotgun shells into someones face and they can kill you in 1 punch.  If you like to constantly replace your mouse keyboard and headphones from rage caused by game then this is the game for you. Updates come extremly slow and is on par with pokemon go as far as release schedule 2 years in we finally have trading. something the game was advertised to have from the begininng, Not to mention that there is hackers who play regularly and get banned and they create a new acct continue cheating and transfer purchase to new acct. Vehicles react in abnormal ways. They motorcycle hits a pebble and pulls a full speed stoppie and kicks you off vehicle to die. Guns glitch causing ADS issues with terrible clipping from map causing your avatar to shake and glitch giving away your position. Would rather play cuisine royal because at least it is polished more graphically although game play is clunky still does not cause same rage as pubg.Not to mention the only way you can get customizable character clothing but at a cost of real money to open 90% of the loot boxes you recieve by purchasing boxes with earned in game currency. Maybe if there was an option to buy keyless boxes separated from premium boxes would be better but not even that is an option,The biggest streamers for this game are as well over and fedup with this game and publicly denounce it. My guess is the next 3 updateas and the new map stated to be released winter this year will probably cost money like an expansion pack. In my best opinion you can tell that the company is trying to make as much money as the physically can without doing anything to earn it. Heres some new content that if you want access to you must complete all these quests and pay 9.99 for a month pass.One suggestion i would say to make in game change for the spawn situation. How about we air drop and for the first 2-5 minutes of game you can respawn randomly where there is no one currently looting. That way the long wait for a game to start isn't at odds with a very short game caused by poor loot or slow loading of the game. After that time has passed, you no longer respawn and must restart a game."

To be strong again they need a lobby system similar to Battlefield where you see the population and join the server what is nearly at peak levels...can i see this happening....probably not...also OC players have the patience of a goldfish if they aint popping ques instantly they move on...Great game. few hackers there and then and server collapses but what game doesnt.

This didn't used to be the case, the in-game content that you can earn now almost always requires you to buy a key to unlock. What's the point (aside from making more money) to charging for literally everything in the game. You can, however, get that occasional box that you can unlock for free, but I still have yet to get that. Keys for this game cost $2.50, not much for one, but every box you get will require you to buy another one. I sure as hell am not going to put that much money into the game. The only problem now with in-game currency is that it has pretty much become worthless, since the game is just going to require you to buy more products. I'm going to continue to play the game and get boxes, but i'm not going to pay to open them. I'll just go and sell them on the community."

The issues I have are:1) Terrible loot rng on all maps but sanhok2)Terrible circles on all but sanhok3)Terrible visibility(game is extremely washed out) and directional audio on all maps4)Poor weapon balance (especially bolt actions and the vector)5)Too quick of a time to kill, which should not be the case in a game with random circles where positions cannot really be learnt, thus leaving someone no time to reactIt boggles my mind how this game can be considered competitive, even with pro league settings. The game is just way too random. The only thing that can be considered skillful in this game is the gunplay, and is literally the only reason I sometimes enjoy playing this game."
578080,1,0,cashmoneyvagrant,316,7,-1,600.4,"5 August, 2018","i've had more than enough after 600 hrs spent. i have played maybe 2 hours solo, the rest was with friends. most of them stopped playing. i un- and reinstalled the game a couple times after being frustrated again and again. i seriously don't know how i could rack up so many hours in this game while at the same time enjoying so little of it. i blame it on social pressure and that half my friends list wanted nothing but to play pubg for the last year. surely spent about 100 of those hours in menus alone. what's good? gunplay feels good and semi-realistic in mid to long range engagements. the maps have some nice vistas. playing in a squad with friends can be fun. that is actually all i can think of. i kept playing like many others in hopes they'd fix the rest up, but they never did. what sucks? almost everything else.-controls? still janky as hell with no real flow from running into vaulting or basically doing anything.-netcode? still bad, framedrops when you encounter other players like in dayz, rubberbanding, you or the enemy believing to be in cover while actually lagging behind and really hanging out in the open, hits registering after you turned into cover, you yourself killing people in dubious ways that feel undeserved-graphics? while the maps look alright as long as you're not moving the player models are like advanced ps2 models. seriously wtf is wrong with the hair on the player models, that's not hair. wtf bluehole. also there are still many graphic bugs and glitches in the game. bodies and weapons floating in mid air, parked vehicles appearing to have an epileptic seizure is a common thing. the game has no artstyle at all and what original assets there are are not very impressive or beatiful.-gameplay? it's fun from the point you get the hang of it and get better, as long as you aren't burned out already by the games jankiness. i haven't played all the br games out, so i can't comment on the balance of the map and circle play much, but i think it works alright in sanhok and erangel, while miramar is a borefest. how much you get out of it ultimately depends on your willingness to try and git gud, so to speak. the game will never really reward you for it tho. this is because the game attracts hackers and gives incentive to camp and ambush. if you are good at this game you will constantly be well placed and probably even win regularly, but you will also be killed cheaply a lot of the times, and you will start to camp and play like a coward yourself. i found that at that point, where you think of yourself as being somewhat good at the game, it's less fun. because there will be all these rules in your head what is alright to do now and what not. and then the game will become like work. you will argue with your friends in the squad and people will be????????????????????????because everyone thinks they know the game and that they are smart about it. this game produces bitter burn outs, one dude in my friends list actually told me he will never play again with a mutual friend, after they had a falling out in pubg. wtf... -what else? ????????????ing lootboxes, terrible cosmetics you wouldn't even want your character to wear, every update that adds something makes some other thing that worked fine worse, every new gun is op at first, then later nerfed to hell and back. the new challenges are terrible. war mode is fun maybe once every few weeks, this week i checked back because war mode was the only thing i enjoyed playing lately with my friends and some of us wouldn't even bother with regular matches anymore. they made a mode where they just took out all the guns except the .45ers. wtf bluehole. this supposed to be war mode. this is just normal squads on sanhok with less guns. who thought this was a good idea? war mode is cool whenever it makes the game less tedious to play. so short rounds, respawning, high powered guns, basically a death match. metal rain is at least an interesting concept. but this weeks war mode is further confirmation that bluehole actually has no clue what makes this game fun and just shoots blind and every once in a while happens to hit the mark. i got the game key from a friend back then, but would never shell out 30 bucks for this. if you really need to check this game out, try to get it somewhere for about 5 bucks, that's what it's max worth is imo for the little actual fun you can have with this game. the only way i'd reinstall this again would be if they would revamp the game from the ground up and actually addressed all these issues, but i have no hope for that. they will continue put out ?????????????????? lootboxes, they are planning to monetize custom servers as well and that is all they are working on, money making schemes. i hope brendan greene will not put his nick in the title of a game he worked on, because that would be an instant no buy. if you put your ????????????ing name on it, you should be about fixing it, not doing fancy talks at conventions about esports. have you even played your own game? actually forget what i said about getting it for 5 bucks. buy a different game, or play fortnite instead. i haven't played this a lot but i actually wholly enjoyed my time although i thought i'd hate. it's a real professional game while pubg is almost a  glorified asset flip with decent gun play that gained cultural significance by accident and peer pressure. don't believe the hype, avoid at all cost. i could have learned a language in those 600 hours, that is also semi-fun, but at least it builds up your intelligence in character. playing pubg is like planning an assassination on your own soul and intellect. save yourself"

You also cannot use the in game voice chat, because of all the Chinese propaganda being broadcasted in the waiting zone.All in all it used to be a great game, but now you can just as well go play Cuisine Royale, because the only reason you will buy this game is if you are a masochist that likes being constantly murdered by hackers."

Launched the game yesterday and still can't get back into the game after I quit like 5 months ago, recoil is changed so much to the point where I find the guns not having the same feel as they used to.The game in its current state is a looting simulator and a small part combat if you spawn outside of most busy zones.If you do decide to spawn in a busy zone like po???????????????i and such you can win if you master the guns with current recoil which is insane for me and not feel like old pubg days.Do not recommend the game for new players, if you are a day 1 player RIP PubgPubg if you read this remove 3 man bike please haven't driven it since 5 months ago but that vehicle is garbage."

Can't tell where foot sounds are coming from, can't tell which direction your being shot from to take proper cover. Decent weapons on Miramar are really hard to come by, making it difficult to engage in fire fights. Solo battles are a nightmare with alot of campers. Best way to do good at this game is to buddy up and play Duo's or squads. This game is not worth the 30$ price tag it has on it. I regret my purchase of it. If you want to play PUBG just get the mobile version for you phone or Download the Tencent gaming buddy emulator for pc and play it like that.

Online multiplayer games are based on User Internet Speed. If a user has high speed internet and a expensive alienware - PUBG is best suitable for them. Although while playing this game I found many game stuck moments which were not expected on a decent loaded desktop. For a 17 GB file size game, this game is still a experimental beta. Developer needs to understand the perception of optimized gaming rather than high performance gaming. Also gameplay was as similar to payday2, due to extreme highly detailed environment the aim and shoot time sync sucks. Recommended Note for new buyers - First get a high performace loaded desktop or laptop and atleast 10 Mbps connection to play this game. And if you are new to this game, bare with stupid players who dont understand the meaning of friendly fire and kill their own team mates."

It's barely budged from where it was.  It's rough, choppy, struggles with cheating problems, and tries to bleed money out of people through loot boxes even though A. the game made hundreds of millions of dollars through it's asking price B. the cosmetics in this game are kinda awful and C. none of the money is clearly going into polishing this game.I have a lot of fond memories of PUBG, but honestly the game is just getting too frustrating to play, it's squandered potential.  So many other people are throwing their hats into the Battle Royale genre, like Hunt: Showdown, Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, and of course Fortnite, and all of them seem to have their act together much more than PUBG does.  And Totally Accurate Battlegrounds was made a joke.  PUBG was a trend setter, but now it's been reduced to a trend chaser.  Hence why it came out with an inferior version of the Fortnite Battle Pass.Between that, and PUBG's toxic behavior towards anyone who attempts to mimic the Battle Royale genre, particularly those who do it better than them, I felt obliged to leave a thumbs down here."

578080,0,0,JohnSpoon,38,5,1,47.5,"3 August, 2018","Playerunknown?€?s Battlegrounds, colloquially known as PUBG (pronounced pub-gee), is if nothing else conceptually efficient. 100 players parachute onto an island. The last one alive wins. An unoriginal idea executed in an original fashion: That?€?s the merit of Battlegrounds.Battlegrounds is the culmination of years of genre experimentation by designer Brendan ?€?Playerunknown?€? Greene. Where contemporaries polish the graphical and technical edges of an established formula through iteration after iteration, Greene has been honing the very formula itself. The game is aesthetically bland and prone to technical hiccups, but compared to its battle royale-inspired predecessors ?€? a few Arma mods and H1Z1 ?€? Battlegrounds is refreshingly accessible.Newcomers who don?€?t religiously monitor video game trends can grok the beginning, middle and end of their first match. Players float onto an island, raid vaguely Eastern European towns or dusty ramshackle forts for randomized gear, and stay within the confines of an electric blue circle that slowly shrinks the map from miles of open terrain to a single square foot, forcing all survivors into the limited safe space.Along the way to the center of the circle, the player eliminates the competition ?€? or allows it to fight amongst itself. Whether the player is sniping from a distant cliff, going house to house with a shotgun or simply hiding in the brush, the number of survivors will inevitably tick down as the blue circle pushes them into a spot like a giant trash compactor of conflict.A few hours into Battlegrounds, you get the sneaking sensation that everything, even the smallest detail, has a purpose. For example, every door is closed when a match begins, so doors exist as doors, but when spotted open, also serve as warnings that you aren?€?t the first person to arrive at a home. Military bases and cities house powerful weapons, but that attracts more players, and thus more conflict. For a time, high-level players began to memorize the direction in which cars would be parked by default, so they could tell an untouched vehicle from a honeypot. The more you play, the more you learn how to speak Battlegrounds.That?€?s the trick of Battlegrounds: a simple arc that ?€? based on the aggressiveness of players, the randomness of weaponry and the spot in which the circle ultimately closes ?€? can play out in nearly infinite ways, depending on how you read the situation from one second to the next. But like a procedural crime drama, PUBG always hits those same three key beats: Land on the island, gear up, survive to the end. Each round has a sense of progress, of growth, of construction.Of course, construction inspires destruction. We humans like watching things that took time to construct be cooly extinguished. Smashed Lego sets, controlled demolition, a player who?€?s collected the best weapons and armor getting pummeled with a frying pan. Because every player knows intimately the effort that goes into building a kit of weapons and armor, they too know the sweet joy of ending someone?€?s game, concluding their 15 or 20 minutes of raiding with a damp thwack to the skull at the last moment.In Call of Duty, even the losers get experience points, progressing them through some arcane skill tree. The same isn?€?t true in Battlegrounds, where players take great pleasure, consciously or not, from spoiling the fun of their peers. To survive a round is to savor the fact that 99 other people did not.The combo ?€? progression and regression, construction and destruction, total success and total failure ?€? gets at some deep existential pleasure, like rubber bands gradually being wrapped around a watermelon until it explodes. Battlegrounds never feels safe, because at any moment your hard work can be obliterated by a fearless newbie driving a buggy directly into your would-be hideout. Across a hundred hours of play, I?€?m most ashamed of the number of times somebody accidentally ran me over while I laid prone in a supposedly safe sniping perch.This central theme makes Battlegrounds particularly watchable. Since its informal launch in March, millions of players and non-players have flooded YouTube and Twitch to watch matches, whether they?€?re competitive, lighthearted or both. As with a good sport, viewership captures the spirit of Battlegrounds without requiring all the skill and practice necessary to not only participate, but create exciting moments.For would-be viewers, this isn?€?t like so many other esports that feel impenetrable to nonplayers, let alone nongamers. And for would-be players, this isn?€?t like so many first-person shooters of the past decade that created an artificial sense of skill, allowing players to upgrade weapons over time to conjure the illusion of self-improvement.Battlegrounds is only as forgiving as its players, which is to say, the meek shall not inherit its earth. Worse, some players have turned to hacks or controversial noninvasive tools and techniques (stream-sniping, modifying the color saturation) that provide a competitive edge. Some headaches, unfortunately, stem from odd design decisions and fixable blemishes. The game?€?s controls lack the smoothness of modern shooters, collecting items feels unintuitive, ammo and weapon information is obtuse, and high-end graphics actually serve as a disadvantage: Low-end graphics settings remove bushes and other greenery players might use as camouflage.I am not the first person to say Battlegrounds is broken, nor am I the first to say it doesn?€?t really matter. It?€?s like when somebody tells you their favorite film is Apocalypse Now, but they can name all its historical inaccuracies, plot holes and production gaffes. Greatness can be, and often is, messy.There?€?s a case to be made that Battlegrounds is the defining game of 2017, both one of the year?€?s best games while also being the embodiment of the current video game industry. It?€?s a brash multiplayer shooter set in an open world, akin superficially to the medium?€?s best-selling franchises. PUBG?€?s also an indefinite work in progress, a de facto status it shares with most AAA games with massive teams operating on tight budgets and impossible deadlines.With PUBG?€?s official release, players finally gain access to its second map, a small and open desert stage that, on test servers, often stutters and crashes. And Xbox One owners now have access to a six-month-old version of the game, in early access on console, where its controls and performance leave even more to be desired. And once again, the general reaction is fury mixed with euphoria.Battlegrounds manages to exist within the crowded shooter genre in an unfinished state, and feel both fresh and creatively complete. From its early access launch on March 23 to its official launch today, Dec. 20, its creators have had nine months to repair, polish and expand on their baby. That the most substantial updates have been improved server performance, vaulting and car horns speaks to the confidence Greene and his squad have in the game?€?s foundation.And they should feel confident. Though it?€?s perpetually rough, you get the sense while playing Battlegrounds, both in March and today, that the developers are constructing the game from a blueprint found only in Greene?€?s own mind.Unlike most popular literature and films, most video games teach you how to read them, which is to say they?€?re as much about the content as how you experience that content. Many games rely on the familiar language of games ?€? red barrels explode, blinking red spots on an enemy mark its vulnerability ?€? only introducing a few new phrases of play along the way. But games that upend established genres or inspire entirely new ones teach new languages, which in turn get polished, contorted and improved upon by future games.Battlegrounds is the refinement of a new language of play, but what may earn it a spot in the video game canon is that conceptual efficiency. It isn?€?t accessible for every player, but it"

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,77,1,-1,474.8,"3 August, 2018","I tried giving this game a go, and when it first came out it was actually fun. But now the game is a shadow of its former self, and quite honestly not worth the time or money. Here's why:- Lets start with the biggest thing...the experience. EXPECTATION: The trailers give the sense of an action packed shooter where the will be a constant struggle to survive against other players, with intense gunfights, the possibility for a melee with other players, and a final showdown where you are pitted against another player head-to-head and toe-to-toe.REALITY: The player base has become so obsessed with getting the ""chicken dinner"" that they will play in the most cringey way possible in order to get it. Imagine all the things you used to hated people for doing in shooters previously is now considered ""good gameplay"". This makes it to where you are pretty much playing a game where you are spending about 90% of the time looting and walking (or in most cases running) to the safezone, and most ""firefights"" you will get into is either some cheeky player hiding in a building you have to go loot because the drops gave you nothing but a sickle to fend off players with, or some sniper will be taking potshots at you as you are running to the circle.  To sum it up, think of this game as a walking (or like I said earlier running) simulator where you occasionally get shot at. -Next, the gunplay...EXPECTATION: Solid gunplay where you can use whatever weapon the game gives you to secure your win your win, so long as you play to its strengths.REALITY: Bullet detection is laughable at best. Most players gravitate towards nothing but AR's, DMR's, and sniper rifles because those are the most powerful guns at any range. Hardly ever will you see anyone play to endgame with any of the other guns, unless that was all the RNG gods gave them to work with, because towards end game, the safe zone almost always closes in a field, cliffside, or wooded area where any chance at CQB is out the window and all the enemies you will face will do nothing but snipe from a bush or some hill. Not to mention the armor and medical supplies caters to that gameplay because if they can get cover after you shoot them and heal up, it really becomes a game of whoever has the most armor and healing supplies.  And you can pretty much forget about getting melee kills after the initial drop, because the footsteps in this game are so loud, you would not be able to sneak up on your hearing impaired grandma.-And last but not least, the community:EXPECTATION: A decent community where the majority of players want a fun, action packed game. Most people play fair and just want to have fun. (I say most because I know no matter what game, there will be people who try to cheat.)REALITY: Between the influx of hackers and cheaters, the general attitude of the player base, and Bluehole' preoccupation with squeezing as much money as they can from this game rather than polishing what they have and making the game great, the community is a toxic as they come.In conclusion, this game had the potential to be great. The concept was great. But the execution was lacking. If you want a solid shooter with realistic gunplay, there are better games. If you are looking for a battle royale game where the community and the matches are fun, there are better games.  If you want the rush of surviving against all odds, there are better games."

Buy the game because you might be surpised .When i started off in the game your most likey gonna know nothing, it's like any other battle royal game nowadays, 100 people drop the last one standing wins.It takes lots of time to get use to the game and know what to do. Now i get back to back wins. I studed the game, how players try to play like sneaking so you dont wanna be in that postion of where someone will go behind your back and shoot you.PUBG is a amazing game but it just takes some time. Remember you have 3 hours of play time before you can return the game for your money back if your not happy with the game."

Nonetheless I still don't play this game anymore since some of the descisions the developers made (remove map selection, investing their time on skins rather than game improvement, etc.) and >200h in the game make me feel like im stagnating whenever I'm playing the game. It just isn't fun anymore after this time. However playing the game with 1-3 friends still is quite a lot of fun and I recommend doing so."

This game actually managed to get worse over time.

By that measure you could say that I got my moneys worth. Now onto the review. As a player with over 900 hours I know the game pretty well and can definetly tell you that this game is not a good game. At the surface it looks and sounds good but once you get into the game you realize how buggy and inconsistent it is. For a game mode like Battle Royale where you invest tons of time and effort into a single match (~20-30mins per match) there is no room for bugs that outright kill your player or make it unplayable. The game is infested with hackers and their sad attempt called #fixpubg has made the game even worse, even with a campaign that was meant to fix the game. They roll out new skins and pay to open crates but they don't fix any of the game breaking and immersion breaking bugs that this game has. I highly suggest you look into other BR games to play or download the mobile version of this game. The developers for the mobile version have done an excellent job and put the developers at bluehole to shame. This game is nothing more than a cash grab at this point."

The buggy mess of an experience that it is consistantly send you back to the desktop with a crash error, which then fires up the buggy bug reporter. And yes, I said buggy bug reporter because you need to pray to the Gods that the thing will actually work. D-sync issues are still present, after years of development and the enhancements being made are welcome but well overdue and there's simply too much to fix. The team also seems to be more interested in esports and cosmetics to make even more money when it doesn't even deserve the asking price in its current state.I gave PUBG the benefit of a doubt as much was promised in the way of optimization and improvements. The former has occured, it's at least easy to open doors without lagging and having to click on one four times before the game decides to register your input, but with more IAP content available, it's becoming a joke. It was only a matter of time before a AAA developer came along and rolled out its own BR that runs better."

578080,1,0,ThuggishSlinky,86,13,1,27.4,"2 August, 2018","Tired of all the reviews that don't help at all? Me too, maybe this one will help.Loads of people say the game is still unoptimized and doesn't run well. I don't have a very beefy rig and I get 60-140 fps on Ultra, always. That is quite a large range, and further optimization will solve that, but for now, it's just fine.My specs:Intel Core i5-8400 (6 cores at 2.8 - 4GHz)16GB RAMGeForce GTX 1060 3GBMy build is very modest. In fact, it's considered a budget build. You can build it for ~$600 right now. It's worth noting that I run all of my games at 1366x768, since that's the native quality of my TV/monitor. Anyone who has the minimum or recommended specs that is running the game at a reasonable graphics preset and doesn't get 60+ fps, just lower the resolution to 720p and don't cuss out the devs because of your ignorance.----Concerning network lag and server quality:----I never experience any network lag. I am located in the Western US and use the appropriate server. Anyone experiencing network lag is likely not using the best server for their location, or needs to pay for higher bandwidth/throughput somehow, whether it be by upgrading their router, upgrading their network interface card, or upgrading their service plan to at least 100Mb/s. Not many people know this, but there is a huge difference between a megaBIT and a megaBYTE. There are 8 bits in a byte. If you pay for 100Mb/s internet, your top download speed will be in the neighborhood of 12.5MB/s on average. (Mb = megabit, MB = megabyte)----Gameplay----If you enjoy battle royale games, and enjoy a good military shooter experience, this game is for you. It's realistic (within reason), and the game features real-life vehicles. This game is in an entirely different league than Fortnite, and this game makes me dislike Fortnite because of Fortnite's lack of realism and added unnecessary building that adds another layer of learning and complication. If you want to get good at Fortnite, get good at building and you're fine. If you want to get good at PUBG, get good at being accurate and constantly being situationally aware. My literal only complaint is the fact that the pre-game lobby has a 1-minute wait time. One minute is almost nothing, but it still makes me feel like it takes much longer to get into a game than it should.Overall, I give this game a 4/5, and trust me, the average gamer does not know at all what it takes to create and produce a game. The devs are doing a great job."

I click the icon, crash report opens, thats it. While looking online for solutions I found that this is not an uncommon problem either, people on forums saying they couldn't get on for four months straight because it would crash on startup.

578080,1,0,7.65612E+16,187,1,-1,546.4,"2 August, 2018","My most played game on Steam by far, PUBG is more like a drug than a game. At first it was addicitive no matter the time I played, or how I performed. As time passed I found myself pulled back time after time, but enjoying it less every moment. That's generally the case with most games, but the reason in those games is repetitive gameplay or lack of change. PUBG tends to feel different each match. What makes this game frustrating to continue to support is:Cheaters: Every patch seems to break the anti-cheat, and suddenly you're facing autoaim/wall hacks every other match.No region lock: Peakers advantage sucks, but allowing players from thousands of miles away to abuse it sucks more.Optimization: I have a good PC, but let's be honest, even streamers with the best rigs complain. My biggest gripe on this front, weapons not loading at the same time for everyone. Ever land TOO SOON and the guy behind you gets the M4 you didn't see because it just wasn't there?Loot crates over real content: The way this game took off there is no reason for the focus to be on monetizing over polishing, creating new content in game, optimization, bug fixes, or any of the other defunct areas seemingly overlooked by the developers. This is not a free to play game, and it's sold a huge amount!There's still a lot of potential for the game; whoever is in charge just needs to change focus from capitalizing on its past success and focus on creating it into a game that can truly stand the test of time."

I am genuinly starting to think that this pile of broken trash game is run by EA, the game can only be fun with a couple of friends and trust me even then the core game issues will ruin the fun. But you know what? It's not the devs' fault, it's the competition that is causing problems like these, so how about we sue them eh? Seems reasonable right? Right, now that we've done that, how about we make more skins huh? Is the next ""problem solving thing"" for PUBG just gonna be shooting all the fans that are dissapointed and mad that this game is in a possibly worse state than when it came out?

The main reason i won't recommend it is because of the guys who run the game, they seem to only have interest in money these days but thats just my opinion. I had a long break from the game and only came back to it yesterday and played roughly 8-10 games i think and encountered someone using aimbot, i was spectating because i came top 10 and thought id just see who wins and the dude in question was shooting from the hip with a AK and whilst the gun was recoiling it would snap back on to the target, then just earlier i was on Sanhok solo and 2 dudes appear at a window trying to shoot me (and failing as well which was amusing) obviously teaming but still somehow killed them both xD.

This game did not start off as a polished game. Even after version 1.0 came out it has been like a beta. But you have to take into accont that this game is not expensive, you are not forking out over $100 like you would for Battlefield 4 etcWhats great about this game is the level of competativeness that comes with the battleroyal format. You need to take this game with a level of seriouness otherwise you will just die round afrer round with little to no reward.Even with all it's faults, (which slowly get fixed with every update) I find this game way more challenging than the average FPS. Working your way to the top 10 is very exciting and rewarding in itsself. Something you just can't get from spawn & die, spawn & die type of games.Keep in mind it can be hard to match a game in some regions like OC if you want to play Solo or duo in FPP which is extreemly disapointing.

This game has given me some of the most exciting moments i've experienced in any game I've ever played . However, now the game is no longer in early access, but the problems with the game seem to have multiplied. The entire game feels incredibly sluggish and stuttering and crashing happens far too often.?????????????????? even the crash reporter crashes every time I've tried. And it's not like my PC is to blame, with a gtx 1080. And somehow my game drops to like 30 fps every once in a while. The devs can't seem to do anything about these problems except make them worse. I would definitely steer clear of this game, at least in its current state. If somehow the game gets better or you can somehow ignore these issues, I would say that if you have friends to play with, then this game is great for enough hours to get your money's worth and more. Also, many seem to have problems with rampant cheaters, but I can say that I haven't ever seen someone that I 100% knew was cheating in all my hours. I guess people's experience on that one varies"

578080,0,0,jittrs,10,1,1,87.3,"1 August, 2018","Why PUBG is the definitive BR experience After playing IoN, H1Z1, Fortnite, and other BR?€?s, PUBG still is the definitive BR experience at the time of this writing. So let me tell you why I think PUBG is the definitive BR experience  Unparalleled gunplay- PUBG?€?s gunfights feel tactical, yet face paced. Your player is weighted while not feeling too clunky.   The drop- You can drop when you want. This might feel like a small detail but some BR?€?s don?€?t allow you to do this simple act. This allows you to be tactical about where you land and learn ?€?your area?€? if you choose to pick a consistent place to land.  Looting- Looting is quick and easy and the interface is simple. You put what you want into your back pack and choose what you want to attach to your guns or what armor to protect you. You can also drop exactly what you want. No other BR that I have played has the same snappy feel that PUBG does  The loot- Attachments that you actually care about, armor that you actively search for because you want the better protection ???? , and health that is quick and easy. The attachments you pick up actively modify your weapons stats and are easily noticed and comprehended. No other BR that I have played has made me want the best armor for my character because no other BR has the level system like PUBG which just works, plain and simple. Need to heal quickly? Well if you have a medkit you?€?re good bro. Also, I love that you can Pre-heal or increase sprint speed with boosts if you know you?€?re going to get in a gunfight you can heal intermittently after getting shot  The new and improved zones (especially on Sanhok) feel paced and don?€?t rush you too much. Although some of the times are fast, the map compensates for being small and the zone moving in slowly.   Guns, guns, guns- No other BR that I have laid my hands on has more unique weapons and variety than PUBG. Each gun has it?€?s use and is suited to different play styles. SMG?€?s melt in close range, AR?€?s are good all-around weapons but some are more accurate or have more damage, and sniper?€?s have that clip of the week potential.  Updates- Look you can say what you want about lootboxes ( I HATE THEM TOO) but they do update the darn game. Every so often a new update is hitting the market with new guns, maps, and optimizations (Honestly Update #19 looks like the best yet)  Miramar sucks ok we get it! But the new Sanhok is amazing. I love the pacing, small size, and environment. One minute you could be trotting through the forest then BOOM a wild Kar98k appears and takes half your health and you?€?re heart is racing.  The feel- It?€?s the feeling. The feeling of easily being able to vault over objects (for the most part), the feeling of hitting that sniper shot from a mile away, the feeling of your heart racing because you have not idea where you got shot from and yelling to your buddies to try to find the mother trucker (teamwork matters in this game). When it comes down to it PUBG feels right and will continue to grow and is going to stick around for the long haul. Many BR?€?s have died but this one still maintains and active player count (usually around 300 to 500k). No game is perfect   FIX DESYNC! Is all you will see in every update blog and reddit post. Yes, DeSync is a major issue and I mean major. It?€?s very frustrating to die 3 seconds after you get behind a wall. While it?€?s improved it could still be improved more. Can it be perfect with 100 people spawned on a map at a time in a huge environment? I don?€?t know if we are there yet technologically but it will get there eventually.   I still have to put my graphics card to low on my 1080 to get an optimal experience. If I put my settings all the way up I get stutters and frame drops. The game is nothing to call mom about as far as graphics go at high anyways.  Weird inconsistent lead times on bullets and inconsistent damage on weapons- This could be a personal thing but I feel like I can never get the bullet lead right and guns feel like they are so random on time to kill. This could be due to Desync or something else.  Frame drops, lag spikes, server crash issues- Nothing to say here get to work ????"

I have seen this game progress into something great over the past year, but the flaws may be too much for some.  Pretty much all glitches have been fixed, the only problem which has become quite apparent is desync. Some times, not often, when you are in a close range fight with lots of motion and peeking you may find that you got shot behind cover.  This does not happen to me very often and thats why I dont really have a problem with it.  I just dont like the numerous paid crates and microtransactions, but keep in mind these are only cosmetic items and have no impact on the game.  That being said, there are updates frequently and performance, stuttering, and desync is improved every time.  Many people claim the game is infested with hackers and this is FALSE.  In my (currently) 1223 hours played, I have seen only a few hackers (ON NA SERVERS).  The PUBG community is prone to blaming embarasing or even normal deaths on hackers.  There are also many MANY very fun and non toxic people to play with ex. the reddit PUBG server.  In game comms on all chat are some of my greatest memories in the game.  Don't let people fool you with these common misconceptions."

Think about some of your favorite, cheesy cinematic guilty pleasures. Not those deep dramatic Best Picture nominees, but those explosion-fueled nonsensical action flicks with acting and effects that no one can take seriously, yet everyone still has a blast watching. Take that experience, turn it into a video game, and you've got PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in a nutshell. The reality is that the game isn't exactly the best-looking game out there by a long shot, with stiff character movements and environments that feel like they've just been thrown together on a whim. It's also a game with more than a few glitches. Weapons will occasionally act in completely uncharacteristic and unrealistic ways, sometimes launching players through the air instead of killing them. It's not uncommon to see someone unload a shotgun into another player at point-blank range and miss completely, only to be killed in return with a punch to the face. And yet, like a cheesy B-movie, somehow it all still works. In spite of its quirks, and sometimes because of them, it's just a lot of fun to play.Overall I rate this game 7/10"

Hackers have become commonplace, lag is crazy (as half of the people on US and EU servers are actually Chinese with horrible ping), and it's just generally become a mess.Worst part of it all though, somewhere along the line, the PUBG studio sued Fortnite for copyright on their whole battle royale mode and won.

Paid loot boxes, focusing on putting in emotes rather than fixing issues, right down to getting the Fortnite map re-made into a Vietnam-like area.Overall, used to be fun but got ruined. Shame."

BUT...1) They charge money to unlock challenges.  I honestly don't know what they were thinking here.  2) Certain vanity items you unlock are on a timer and expire so you can no longer wear them after 30 days. WTF?3) Most chests you get require a $2.50 key to unlock where you get an ugly, useless item.4) If you get a chest that does not require a key you still get ugly, useless items.5) They don't care about NA players.  Maintenance is always during prime time NA hours (9pm EST)6) Hackers love this game.7) Desync is a major issue when trying to shoot someone and trying to avoid being shot.I enjoy this game and it is fun to play with other people.  I will even still continue to play it, but I can't recommend it to a new player because it is so unrewarding and they ask for more money at every turn."

The gunplay and the intensity of combat is both incredibly satisfying and addicting.Personally i don't mind lootboxes and cosmetics ( I often enjoy it) but PUBG does have a bit of a problem with the devs trying to squeeze every penny out of its playerbase.Overall i think you should try this game out if you enjoy fun moments with friends in a buggy game or you're a lover of fps and BR.

578080,0,0,zamien_sullivan,262,2,-1,113.3,"31 July, 2018","I honestly WANT to love this game. I enjoy the Battle Royale concept and this game has the best gunplay out of all the BRs I've tried and tested up to this point. Unfortunately, the developers who created this game have a LONG way to go when it comes to optimization, community approval and just generally making this game what it has EVERY ability to be.There are quite a few issues plaguing this game in it's current state. The optimization needs an overhaul. Frame drops, desync, rampant exploitation of known glitches; you name it, they've got it. I have avoided writing a review on this game up to this point because they were doing better about updating the game weekly and fixing SOME of the optimization issues seen in the past. I really thought the developers were starting to get to a point where they could give the community what the community wanted. Now, however, the developers have announced that this is the second week we will see no updates.I can't give a recommendation for this game in it's current state, and that's unfortunate. When this game DOES work, it works very, very well. The gameplay and the graphics are great and I enjoy playing the game quite a bit; however, if you aren't ready to deal with a large amount of cheating/glitching/bugging/crashing, don't buy/install this game just yet. Give it time and hope (like I have) that the developers will get their resources together and make this game GREAT.Last thing to toss into this review: Many have already mentioned this, but it deserves repetition. Bluehole is currently charging $30 for this game. They also have multiple in-game crates/keys/cosmetic items that cost money. So you have to ask yourself, with how much money they are bringing in from this game, HOW have they not dedicated some of that to hiring a team with enough experience to FIX the bugs and FIX the cheating.I honestly hope they make this game more playable and more enjoyable. I'd hate to see this game lose it's potential due to developers being unwilling/unable to fix well-known issues. Fingers crossed..."

578080,0,0,maythesewordsringloud,91,19,-1,27.5,"30 July, 2018","A potentially good game ruined by ABYSMAL map design, atrocious optimization, apathetic developers, and some of the worst controls to ever touch an fps. Seriously, you have to actively fight the game to get your character to respond to movement in all but the most simple gestures... such as running in a straight line. This game wouldn't be worth a look if it was free, much less as a $30 game. I guess elaboration is in order.The map design in this game is unspeakably terrible. The maps are designed specifically to be overly dangerous to traverse and require inhuman spacial awareness to remotely stand a chance of retaliation to an attacker. The random nature of the game is the least of its worries, with 3 or even 4 story buildings populating dense cities that reward cheap play and pacivity. The game's optimization, or lack thereof, is barely worthy of meme status. Anything less than having the game installed on an SSD with the strongest graphics options available will punish the user with low FPS, stuttering, pop-in, late loading textures, pop-in lighting effects and shadows, and a game that is a buggy, unresponsive mess for the first 2 minutes of the match. The Xbox one version is almost comically terrible and is completely unplayable.PUBG corp does not pay mind to the state of the game, unless said state is related to microtransactions.The controls are a joke. This is the Bubsy 3D of FPS, this is the Knuckles Chaotix of the modern era. Performing an action more simple than walking on the floor has hideous delay and slow, muddy physics. You are not in control, you are dragging your character across the map while their feet happen to move by pure coincidence. This is a repeat of Dayz. Don't bother."

We thought about how much fun it would be to just screw around with a few of us, and our discord would pick up the game again and we would all play again like the good old days. But when it got released to the public servers, they changed it to at least 10 people. That removed basicaly the whole point of having custom matches for everyone, because people don't really have 10 friends that will all gladly play PUBG again after months of having not played it, and you will be forced to play with randos who will just ruin the fun for you and your friends.

578080,2,0,yelmirb,175,98,-1,165.9,"30 July, 2018","this game could be the worst case of wasted potential ever.i bought this fairly early on, and for a while, i played it every day. i had 166 hours in it and spent a lot of my free time playing.at first, i was willing to write off the problems in the game (and there have ALWAYS been many) due to the game being early access. after all, if you buy games advertised in that state, you can't expect complete polish. but as time went on, and as bluehole (or is it PUBG corp now?) made more and more money, i was increasingly unwilling to forgive them. as the game transitioned from early access to retail, it got even worse.the first problem for me was how appallingly badly made the game was. the game is horribly optimized runs badly and yet also looks awwful. it's rife with stock assets that, at first, i was willing to write off as placeholders. as time went on, i increasingly started to realize that the issue was simply that bluehole was not willing to hire an adequate team. this is the unreal engine, a VERY common one, and so finding developers familiar with it would not be a difficult task. yet, the horrid optimization, poor graphics and tons of placeholders remained and increasingly stuck in my craw. adding to that, the game was absolutely rife with bugs, many of which were quite literally game breaking (transparent walls) and took ages to fix. the movement is also very janky, and nothing feels smooth.the second was that despite playerunknown saying the game would not have microtransactions while in early access, it did. this was when red flags started to come up for me. bluehole had already made an absolute fortune just off sales alone, and despite work on the glaring, often literally game breaking bugs and glitches being slow in coming when it came at all, they decided they needed even more money from their fundamentally broken game. i have no issue with microtransactions in FTP games, but they have no place in paid titles, especially in paid titles where the devs have no interest in improving or fixing their game.the last and final straw for me was the cheaters. cheaters are absolutely rampant in this game, and there was a time where the entire leaderbords would be cheaters who were openly advertising their hacks. that's not hyperbole. they would make their username a tinyurl link where you could buy their hacks, and then use their dominance of the scoreboard (often for weeks) as advertising. punkbuster has outright admitted that there are unprescedented numbers of cheaters in the game, and that despite banning more than they do any other game, the number remains high. cheaters are a problem in a lot of games, but when there are that many, and they remain a problem for that long, it indicates a fundamental problem with the game. rather than dedicating resources to stopping this, bluehole was too busy further monetizing the game which  had already made hundreds of millions from sales. early on, players wanted the servers region locked both for reasons of lag and stability (the servers were often overloaded, resulting in massive lag, and huge influxes of players from far away just made that worse) and also because the vast majority of the cheaters, according to punkbuster themselves, were from china, yet played on US servers for maximum exposure (as, again, they were doing this to sell their hacks and make money)maybe bluehole is just utterly incompetent, or maybe they realized that every time they banned a hacker, they'd buy another copy of the game, thereby making them more money, and continue on. maybe it was a combination of both. regardless, the game was rendered virtually unplayable. a game which already had serious performance issues on both ends was so beset by hackers that you'd often run into them in every game. i quit playing after it all just became too much for me. i wanted to like this game. the concept was good, and i prefer the aesthetic and style to things like fortnite, but the idea was just so badly executed that i would not reccomend this game or games by this developer to anyone. it became readily apparent that they were far more interested in squeezing every dime out of players than offering a good, fun and compelling product. this developer (bluehole), despite their rebranding, is a company known for stolen assets and exploitative mobile games. they will not improve and they have done this before. i legitimately regret that i gave these hucksters even a penny of my money, and i never played with the microtransactions. don't make the mistake i made. don't buy this game. you will be disapointed. this sort of behavior should NOT be rewarded."

578080,0,0,justamutt,17,6,1,96.7,"30 July, 2018","The game isn't perfect. I'm just going to start with that, and many people will say worse than that about it. But it's not a bad game. In fact, I'd say it's pretty damn good.First, the negatives:-lag is a problem sometimes in this game, especially since the latest patch it seems. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. -lag being present most games helps you notice a secondary issue: poor lag compensation. I have been hit and killed by enemies who even serverside couldn't have a line of sight on me. That's just wrong.-I have yet to see a confirmable cheater(though I do suspect a few people), but from what I understand cheaters are not super uncommon.-Car physics are bugged to hell. Though they apparently fixed the bug where motorcycles basically turned into rocket ships when they touched another car at speed.-most of the lootboxes you get are only openable with a real-world valued key. But that's a kind of unimportant point.Neutral point: this game has loot boxes. Oh no. Not like every game that's come out lately doesn't have them. Personally, I feel that they're fine to be in a game as long as what's inside is purely cosmetic, so you can't pay to win. This game has that, so I don't care.On to the positives: -Great gameplay. Seriously, gun fights in this are fun, engaging, and rewarding. When you kill an enemy, you know you earned it(unless it's at the very beginning of a round, where it can be entirely based on what you found). The controls are all right where they should be(with the exception of the use button, but that's because ""e"" is to lean), and everything in the world reacts as you would expect, with a few exceptions including molotovs bouncing off walls and the previously mentioned car physics. Speaking of which...-car physics. I know I mentioned it as a negative before, but it's genuinely funny a lot of the time because of how weird the cars act when they hit things at odd angles. -most of the gun balance is great. Naturally there are a few outliers(negant revolver), but most guns you find in the world, you think to yourself, ""I can make this work."" -Character outfits are pretty well diversified, so you can easily identify buddies in co-op even without the marker over their head. Not a big deal to some people, but I like customization.So yeah, the game has problems. Everyone knows that. Whether it's because you've watched the youtube videos, or you've read the other reviews here on steam, nobody will deny that the game has some work to do. The problem is that people take that to mean that the game is terrible. It's not. In fact, I'd argue that it's leagues better than the competition. Is this game Esports ready? No. Stupid broken car physics can kill you at any time, causing you to lose through no fault of your own. The lag issues could cause you to die to someone you couldn't even see, or shouldn't have seen you. But then again, I don't think the game *should* be an Esport to begin with. It's just not the type of game that lends itself well to that in my opinion. So maybe I'm just not taking this game seriously enough.At the end of the day, though, you choose whether you get the game or not. Do you want to play the game that made battle royale mode so popular? Maybe see *why* it's popular? Do you enjoy first person shooters with nice controls and rewarding gameplay? If your answer to any of these questions was yes, I'd recommend getting this game. If not, I'm sorry.Oh, and by the way, What the company does in the real world doesn't affect the quality of the game they make. So stop bringing that up. We get it, they sued for stupid reasons. That's not a mark against the game."

578080,1,0,MokeyMous,86,3,-1,463,"30 July, 2018","I love this game. I really do. But, my main issue comes from what the devs are doing.These devs aren't trying to make the game any better if they are attempting to sue the competition that provides the engine their game runs off of, provide greedy and ?????????????????? microtransactions that would come in when the game was 'finished', push out the game to XBOX (which was a ????????????ing travesty), etc.I really like this game because it offers combat that I like. It offers me combat that Fortnite doesn't. I personally wanted a shooter like PUBG for a long time, and I am thankful. However, if the developers continue their incompetent behaviour, the game will die. I want this game to do well, but with the direction of the game as it stands, it will continue to be plagued by bugs and poor optimization, while the developers at Bluehole do nothing but do Class A drugs and make more money off of it, rather than make even more money and make the game better.I would not advise you to play this game unless you are stubborn like myself for thinking this game will get better. I also advise you check out Fortnite, as Epic Games are doing a decent job at making the game (as they provide consistent updates, fixes, content, etc)."

Anyway I actually do recomend this game if you seem intrigued, you may suck at first but you'll get the hang of it pretty fast, unlike my friends who don't really kill a whole lot, me having to carry, and one guy who just wants to play and doesn't care to win, He says its a chilling game.

You also have the added benefit of being able to sell rarer items and get your money back or hit a jackpot if you're lucky.All in all, positive experience, disagree with negative reviews, definitely pick this game up and try it yourself!"

When i already bought this game a couple of months back and most of everytime i restart the game and play it, it says i'm already in the game like wtf dude seriously? I thought backing up the game to steam and unistalling it to reinstall it only to come up with a piece of??????????????????thing the devs just did. After getting to the last point of restore backup game file, i come up with an error saying i can't continue the update since its content lock and there is this ""WindowsnoEditor.apk""??????????????????that won't allow me too. Like are you serious? Because of a crash i cant play the game now because it thinks im illegally playing the game? WTF bring me my money back dude, i'm already bad at the game and just play for the ??????????????? and giggle by playing hide and seek with the enemies and i cant do that anymore? THIS GAME ALREADY SUFFERS FROM ?????????????????? GUN RECOIL, Apparently using the the uzi gives you perfect shot to your enemy from like close to lets say accross the road with like zero gun vertical recoil than an assault rifle with complete set of attachment to increase weapon stability. It even shows that the m4a1 has better recoil management than uzi but the uzi has perfect recoil than an assault rifle with grips and?????????????????? Trust me an uzi is suppose to have the ???????????????iest recoil manage management than an assault rifle in full spray with complete recoil reduction attachments. Well guess its time to say goodbye to it anyway, I was just using it to gain money buy selling cheap crates in the steam market anyways. If you have this game and you love it, i hope you dont come accross this bug cause it'll make it unplayable. I've tried to log out and log in again only to see that it says the game is running when its cleary not, also if you think i've gave free access of my account to other users then i'll tell you that i dont because that risks my account not being returned to me, 2nd restarting the computer doesnt fix the issue with the steam getting this bug where it thinks im in the game when i'm not, it doesnt show in the steam that i'm playing it but when i click the game and get to the main screen it says ""unauthorized access to steam"" which clearly thinks my account is in the game and log in and thinks that a 2nd computer is trying to log in to the game and the steam then gives unauthorization to it which results to the situation i am in, it's not something that i can fix with reinstalling steam or the game since its a server bs or steam bs either its not something a user can fix. 3rd reinstalling the game will result with you being unable to completely install it because of this data inside the game files which doesnt allow the game to be edited which means its a data for stopping editing of the game which has a connection to cheating, i assure i've never done cheating on any games connected to online gameplay because getting banned in a game i payed is really ?????????????????? as it means i just wasted my money for something stupid. It results in content lock since the bug of the steam/pubg server thinking im in the game when i'm not results in me not being able to install/play the game. If it gets fixed then thats nice but if itsn't then i guess im not returning to a game or community that doesn't see me as a relevent person though if i was a person who advertise the game lets say shroud then it gives high chance of this  situation getting an attention but i guess not. Well bye anyways i probably look like a toxic player,cheater, or some person who just wants to complain but i assure you i'm not the toxic player and cheater but i did complain in this review, My main purpose though is to let everyone know of this new issue that has just arised and hope noone ends up in the same situation as i do."

However, over the time, I did see the optimization getting a lot better, the servers are getting a lot less laggy, while hacks still exist, it's not like there are no hacks in other games at all.To respond to my friend who thought, at least 8 months back, that he could do well in CS but cannot do so in PUBG, here's my answer to him, as well as to any other person who also has this confusion: PUBG is an Army Simulation Battle Royale, so everything counts towards how a bullet goes out - wind, recoil, gravity, ammo's velocity and speed, ballistics, etc. It's different from Counter Strike because in CS the ballistics are not affected that much since the entire map is only couple hundred square feet. This is also why games like Battlefield and, heck, Fortnite doesn't require much of skill from games like Counter Strike.To respond to why PUBG can be bought in Mainland China for so cheap, my answer is that you need to know 1. what kind of a market MLC really is and 2. there are rumors that Steam is going to make MLC a seperate region, basically like what every other gaming platform did. The second one is certainly not what we, who have friends in MLC, want to see, but it's certainly a better solution to both sides.Overall, play fortnite, that's how they do it now."

That being said, there are so many small things they could do to make the game more enjoyable (that don't involve netcode).1) Custom matches like they were on the test server. 2 people to start a match instead of 10. I'm sure they must've had a reason to change it the way they did, but it's far less enjoyable now. Those couple days of test server custom matches were the most fun I've had in PUBG. 2) If they can't swing OG custom matches, then perhaps they could add a firing range like Tencent has in PUBG Mobile. I believe at some point Brendan Greene stated that a firing range wouldn't be in the spirit of the game. If that's really it, then it's time to face the facts my dude, you're not making an art piece, you're making a game. Let's have some fun.3) Arcade modes with smaller circles and/or fewer people (8-minute matches and Mini-zone), just like Tencent has in PUBG Mobile. 4) Greater AR/DMR/SMG/Sniper spawn rates. Sanhok's drop rate is pretty good, but it was better in the early stages of the experimental server. I'm not sure why it's a gameplay element that you have to hunt around for a good 3-5 minutes sometimes to find an AR, especially in places like Po???????????????i. Maybe they could do a testing period with increased weapons spawns. If only there was something of a test server to do that on...5) Separate the crates you buy with in-game currency and the ones you buy with real-world money through keys. The in-game currency is more or less totally useless right now, and it's really the only thing you get at the end of a match. I read on a forum that this is just how crate systems are, and that if we didn't like Bluehole ""giving us free money"" (by selling crates on the marketplace for $2-3 each), then we could basically shove it. Unfortunately just about every single crate is worth $.03 now, so that dude should probably do some re-evaluating. Anyway, it's frustrating that you can't just spend the in-game currency and know you'll get a crate you can actually open without spending $2.50.6) Please set the default firing mode for freshly picked-up weapons to full-auto. It would be extra cool if they came loaded.7) If there's not going to be test-server-like custom matches or a firing range, a dedicated deathmatch mode (or permanent War Mode) would be great to get some practice before hopping into a match or just messing around. It can be rather difficult to find a good match that will actually fill up on the custom games as-is."

I loved the original map, the hills, the color, the positioning in strategic gameplay was fun. The desert map it just constant flat plains. Everyone just stands around in open fields waiting to get shot from any direction. The color of the desert map is abysmal, naturally because it's a desert. It really weighs on my eyes to see everything in different shades of dull tan. Very visually unappealing. TLDR: Desert map changes stratiegic playstyle for the worse, and looks awful and feels dull, you also have no choice in map selection.A thing about gameplay that always bugged me with this game is that it feels very awkward to control. I'm sure many people have overcome this, but I never got over how awkward and hard it felt to make my character do what I wanted, and I've been playing games since I was a child. As far as player movement and control goes, a game like R6:Siege feels amazing and like you're very much in control. I would say the difference in player unit control is comparable to League vs Dota. In League your player moves the second you click, you have instant reaction time, where as in Dota your character model must do a full turn around and then walk in that direction before you actually start navigating where you had clicked.A bit of a rambly review with odd comparisons to popular MOBA games, but hopefully it's useful to someone."

It has had many ( mostly painful ) phases.PUBG in the beginning appealed to a hardcore crowd, until they made it so teamkilling for gear was bannable and weapon attachments made almost every weapon fire the same. The game wasn't about actual survival, it was about everyone having a nice fair chance at victory. In a battle royale. YikesPUBG appealed to a casual crowd, until they shoved it as an e-sport down our throats but couldn't prioritize a decent anti-cheat. Casual gamers won't spend the hours they can spend gaming getting aimbotted. PUBG appealed to nothing but the streamer fan-base of a few popular streamers ( a minority of the people that actually play the game.) This is kind of where the state of the game has halted from a development standpoint. The new map isn't entirely bad, its more of the fast paced style of play that will bring people back to the game. But they need more, 3 maps isn't enough if you're going to completely control the in-game trade economy. The PUBG corporation still does NOT know what theyt want this game to be and its lack of identity and appeal to a specific group has lead tens of thousands of players leaving for games that have their??????????????????together. Siege is a better arcadey shooter for instance, while squad does realism better. PUBG doesn't really do anything well. If you want a game from a development team that doesn't really know if it wants to be realistic or arcadey, that mainly only updates the game based on what streamers want, rather than what the loyal playerbase would have wanted, then this is for you. A mobile game developer on a PC platform is not going to succeed in the long run."

When I want to join a surver it just says ""Started matchmaking"" and gives an estimated amount of time but always fails to actually join the surver no matter how long I have actually waited. It used to never do this, which this is the biggest problem I am currently having with this game. Also the game is very glitchy and lags really bad, even when my internet is working really good.

I mean, I'm no programmer, but I'm sure I could manage to change the game start timer from 60 seconds to 15 seconds in 10 minutes, and 9 minutes and 50 seconds of that would be finding the line in the code!I've tried playing it twice in the last 2 weeks, in the first game I immediately bumped into 2 enemies who had teamed up together in solo mode, and in the second game I got shot by someone with an aim hack.The more time that passes while these fundamentals fail to be addressed, the more I am convinced that the developing company have their priorities totally wrong!

The game itself can be fun, but depending on your viewpoint, the bugs can either ruin your experience or enhance them, depending on if you're tryharding for wins or if you're just trying to have fun with a squad of friends. The biggest issue is the ability to play the game from Oceania, as the OC server itself is a baron wasteland for solo/duo players, who are then forced to play in the Asia/SEA servers, which have a massive number of cheaters/hackers that go unpunished, and if they are punished, there's no way you can tell if you report them. Overall, only play this game if you got it as a gift, and don't spend a dime on it at all. PUBG Corp do not deserve any of your cents until they start making progressive changes in improving the game's functionality, gameplay, and hackers."

At first it as amazing, yeah it had bugs but sooo much potential. I still play it and will continue to play it, let's say im optimistic, or naive idk. So first off cheaters, yes there are cheaters, no you don't see them as much as people claim, most the ""cheating"" people see is caused by the games inconsistency and Extreme desync, but cheaters aren't blueholes fault so we'll leave it. Now the ping issues. How tf can you have an fps with no ping counter?? seriously it's common sense. that way if you get a server with high ping, you can leave and requeue. Or even give us the opportunity to choose servers within a certain range. Yes it may cause longer queue times but it would seriously combat lag ghosts being shot from behind cover, and other latency related issues.Second the Desync. A little optimization goes a loooong way, but let's go ahead and add another crate we can't open because we're not paying 2.50 for stupid keys. The map load times, the inability to pick up items until 30 seconds in coupled with severe stuttering and Fps issues at the beginning, come on this game is 2 years old now, and the early acces sticker was just an excuse to be lazy most that time. these issues should have been dealt with a LONG time ago.It still has wonderful potential to be at the top of the BR genre but atm I can give you too many reasons why fortnite (much as i hate the game) will win in the long run. It's simply better optimized and at least all you have to complain about on fortnite is bouncy shotgunners. Pubg gives me new reasons for complaint with every passing game. So yes I will continue to play it but for now...save your thirty bucks....it's not worth it"

I have a friend who used to play this, and every time we would get in a match, his game crashed. Every game is the same. You loot for 10 minutes, find a vehicle, and get killed by a cheater. But why fix the game when you can just add in scam boxes in a game that costs R$56? (R$ = Brasilian Currency)"

After Brendan Greene started working with the team who created another Battle Royale game Called H1Z1 King Of The Kill he decided he wanted to take is part on the whole Battle royale game and created his own game PUBG. The game gets more hate than it deserves. The cons of it are that there are many hackers, Lots of bugs, and how unoptimized it is. The Game improved alot since release and has optimised the game. You probably couldnt even run this game on a gt 1030 when the game first came out, now you could probably run the game at around 1080p medium settings at 60fps maybe more. People say that he doesnt care about what the consumer wants, and only wants to add cosmetics to make more money but its not really true, there have been so many problems fixed since launch. Yes the more popular BR Game is Fortnite: Battle Royale, but player count shouldn't determine which game you should get. I would give this a 8.5/10Edit: Most bad reviews are from people with patato pcs or ones who die to bugs alot. dont know if its true because i havent ran into more than 3 bugs in the 30-40 games ive played so far, one of them was me getting stuck in the ground and moving very slowly which i fixed by just proning, another was trying to pick items up without dragging them into my inventory, and the other was just me crashing. if you have a pc over $300 you should be able to play it. hell ive seen it being play with a gt 1030. If people tell you that you cant play it with anything but a $1000 pc dont listen to them. My Laptop has a GTX 1050ti, i5-8300h 2.3 ghz multi core processor, and 8gb ddr4 ram with a 256gb ssd and the game runs perfectly on high and medium settings. while this is a $800 laptop with taxes included, you could probably get the same build in a desktop for around $400-$600"

I hate it with a burning passion if it wheren't for playing with friends then i would never of played this game. Fortnite was even a more enjoyable game then this thing. My problems with this games:1 Server Lag. The kill cams never match up with what you saw happening.2 Close range weapons suck espically since they don't have an acurate represntation of a shotgun.3 Game centralizes over avoiding conflict until the end or picking off your enemy at a distance.4 Agian like over half you weapons are close range weapons and still the game is centralize over long range weapons.5 You have to pay 3000bp to change your gender in this game however you can get female cloths so what the hell is up with this.6 Lootbox's obviously a problem, it would be better if it where more like killing floor 2's loot system.

However it's still a raging dumpster fire that is only getting worse. The DEV's are clear and they want one thing: MONEY. They don't understand that improving the game will result in a continuous and larger cash-flow. They would rather duck and run while the getting is good. If you chase leaderboards like I do, prepare to be livid, day in and day out. The DESYNC and overall ""crispiness"" (really word? nope, but you know what I mean) is awful. Countless times a night I will hit 3-4 shots on an enemy and die while the killcam doesn't show my weapon firing a single time. Why? DESYNC. It doesn't matter if they live across the world or across the street. All the data has to travel to China and back first becuase they're servers are there. Speaking of servers... I hope you don't plan on playing the game Wednesday's night if you live in North America. The updates are massive, clunky and typically make things unplayable for the night until the give you a ""hotfix"" 5 hours later and a vomit-inducing twitter apology with the sencerity of a televangelist. In conclusion... I mean what I said at beginning. I love it, I really do, but that's because I've been playing since the 3rd week it was even available. If you're thinking about starting now, I wouldn't waste the money, time and frustration that comes along with No Man's Sk.... *cough* I mean Player Unknown's Battleground. It's unfinished and the DEV's don't care as long as they're lining their pockets with that sweet microtransaction money."

Then Bluehole started milking the community for as much money as possible.  They got it, as players loved the game and thought they were investing in the game for the future.  The money would be put back into the game, we thought.Then came Mirimar, a disaster of a map.  This map pushed players away in their drogues.  Bluehole still pushed for sales of crates and inventory items.  Very little bugs were fixed and the hackers were a nuisance.  There were hackers / exploiters in every games.  Bluehole did not cure the hacker issue but instead milked the community for more money.On full release the game was a disaster.  A game with more bugs than the opening scene from Starship troupers and more cheaters than a Nigerian car boot sale.  They wanted money, thats all they cared about.  Not the community, only money.Now Sanhok came along.  A nice little map with a totally different game play and tactics from the other two.  It gave thje community a boost and the players inevitably followed.  Bluehole foreseen this and introduced the even pass.  They gave us a month of gaming at an additional cost.  The should have went to jail for that.  Its robbery!Nearly 1500 hours later and my thoughts are:  Give us free stuff that we can keep, use and trade.  Fix the bugs, hackers and sack the management of Bluehole.  They are running the game into the ground.  If a good company had developed this game it would be a world beater.  Instead, it will disapear into the oblivion of unplayed games as the one that could have been so much more."

PUBG is actually a good game, lots of potential and it's actually fun to play from time to time. however there are things that you might need to consider before buying. I mean really consider these things.* Hackers - May sometimes be annoying as f*** but I can deal with it just play another round and hope there are no hackers, recently I haven't encountered a lot of them and hackers can be in a lot of games too, not only in PUBG.* Microtransactions - Yes a Let down, but you can get away by not supporting it *wink* *wink* :) Just don't buy it. do not fall into their garbage microtransaction items.* Client and Servers - I cannot stress this enough, but YES THE F***ING SERVERS! I can deal with hackers, microtransactions and all the bullsh*t cosmetics, but man this game's servers sucks bigtime. All the DESYNC, FPS DROPS, LAG, AND DELAY that has been frequently happening!.. Imagine, you are completely hidden after a quick peek, then suddenly you just fell down, saying you got hit by a f***ing sniper and the most annoying part of it is when you click deathcam. You will see that you are already in cover by the time the bullet has been released. **clap clap**.. it's like watching a f***ing low budget movie or a very old movie that has super crappy effects and acting on it. You know what's the worst part of it? it happens FREQUENTLY!Message to the Devs and Producers of the game:- Don't go in full greedy mode guys, spend some of the money you get to the game that's generating it. It's just really annoying that this game gets a lot of money but it seems like they are not spending it for the improvement of the game. Good Game, Sh*ty Servers. not a good combination man, not a good COMBINATION! Short Story : As of the moment, NO! not until they really fix the servers.

I want you to watch the most recent trailer and notice how no one is hitting anyone. Well, that sums up this game entirely. People always talk about the loot boxes or the asset flip and NON of that matters. If a game is fun, then it's fun. The loot boxes are cosmetic only, and I don't see any issues there. However, the gunplay in this game is horrible. I understand they were going for a more realistic feel, but being someone who used to train people to shoot, I can tell you that is not an accurate way to portray realism. You can have your crosshairs on a stationary target, burst firing and still hit nothing. I have run into situations where I had a shotgun at point-blank range miss, and vise versa, I have had people shooting at me with a shotgun two inches from me, and I was able to kill them with an m16. The gunplay in this game feels inconsistent and clunky for a game that revolves around you killing other people. Fixing the gunplay would skyrocket this game to the top and keep it there."

578080,0,0,7.65612E+16,21,1,1,235.8,"27 July, 2018","I give this game a positive review, but it is borderline negative. First of all, it is still a fun game. The game mechanics are cool and the gunplay ist extraordinary. I like the notch of realism this game provides, albeit spraying an m416 real life will not provide the same results as ingame. Same is viable for the other Assault Rifles and Light Machineguns ingame. Ballistics and also the ""time to kill"" is balanced quite well, altough they should remove the limb hits, if you hit someone with 5.56 or 7.62 both will penetrate the Hand/Arm etc. and will result in a body hit. Well I guess it is as realistic as I would take it in a game. For the gunplay, remove the spray'n pray, make single shot more viable and make continuus full auto not sustainable, because in real life it isnt, it takes an excessive amount of force to control an full auto spray on an assault rifle and it is still pretty hard on a sub machinegun. 2-5 bullets full auto burst are pretty much doable for a trained soldiert. Real life, you get the best results with double tapping followed by a head/pelvic shot. knock the vest, penetrate the vest, kill. But all in all, I like the mechanics. I also like the smaller map sanhook, because you get in a game have loot and also, action, thats the best part. Also the update with private servers for everyone ist cool. But why not implement the war mode all the time, which is great for training aim and guns. The negative part, which is why this review has a wee bit of a negative lean is the server/client/client synchro. It happes far to often, that you get shot behind walls or else. And its not all because of cheaters, mostly it is due to the bad sync. It can be pretty depressing to survive a hot drop, have like 2-8 kills or sth and then just die to a guy in a house sitting in a corner and the best part about that sometimes its so laggy, that you dont see him on your screen, but the other player sees you, bam, dead, where was he? darn. You guys should probably add something like a faint breathing sound, or occasional rattling from clothing. Because, no one is dead silent or can move dead silent. It'll but another flavour in the game."
578080,2,0,7.65612E+16,78,1,-1,349.9,"27 July, 2018","This game is one of the best games I have ever played. Honestly. Probably the most fun I have had gaming in the last 5 years. Unfortunately, in the last few months, it's gone downhill. The game it itself is still great, but sometimes it seems impossible to actually find a game. Too many times I've spent 10 minutes waiting for a game, just to exit out because it isn't worth the wait. This is a game where you can die in the first minute - not a problem when queue times were instant - but that is a big problem with 10+ minute queues. I wish I could recommend this game, because it's so much god damn fun. But at this stage, I find it's nearly unplayable. Queues tend to be a faster when you're in a group, which is when the game is it's most fun. But solo has been literally unplayable."

578080,0,0,jonwood007,238,13,1,471.2,"26 July, 2018","So...pubg. Pubg is a game that I have very mixed feelings about.On the one hand, it?€?s literally one of the greatest multiplayer experiences to ever exist. No other game really does what pubg does...as well as pubg does. There are lots of knock offs, but they all fail to recreate the same feeling.On the other hand, the game is very deeply flawed, frustrating, and heading in a questionable direction.All in all I have to say my opinions are more positive than negative, hence the positive review, but again, my impression of it is heavily mixed.So the game itself. You have giant maps full of cities, country sides, forests/jungles, rocky cliffs, etc. They are 8x8km in diameter, with the newest one being smaller at 4x4. The bigger ones are larger than a fallout game or skyrim, possibly on par with planetside 2?€?s maps. You have 100 players dropping in, and the last one to survive wins. Players fight with anything they find at their disposal: a wide array of military grade weapons, vehicles, even a frying pan. Honestly, the thrill I get from playing this game is nothing like I experience in other games. Late game fights can be tense and cause your heart to pound. They?€?re so good you?€?ll be shaking when you?€?re done from the adrenaline. Winning, or even coming close to winning, is an extremely satisfying experience I just don?€?t get in other games. And I play TONS of shooters. But the thing is?€?.the game is flawed. It was made by a small indie company that did not expect it to be a hit. That said, the game has a lot of ?€?technical debt?€? to pay. Performance is a mess. People with top end computers struggle with it on ultra, and even computers capable of running any other game maxed out might need to settle for high or medium settings. If you want high frame rates you might even want to play on low or very low. Stuff takes a while to render and load at the beginning, performance struggles as a result. There?€?s a lot of lag in the game. People die when they shouldn?€?t die, get kills when they shouldn?€?t get kills. What happens on your screen isn?€?t necessarily what the game decides what happened. This can lead to lots of salt and rage.The game is very buggy. You might be cruising around in your vehicle, only to tip over and randomly explode for no reason. You might tip over your vehicle, get out, and then it will magically try to up right itself by rolling over on top of you in the process. You might literally get launched across the map (they might have fixed that one, I hope they fixed that one). Stuff sometimes doesn?€?t render properly. The game is full of bugs and lag.The game also struggles due to its own success. It now has this massive community and attention from all of these professional gamers, but many of them are souring on the game. They petition the devs to implement changes, and then those changes tend to make the experience worse. There is a real demand in the community to make the game more fast paced. This is because streamers play fast paced and people want to emulate streamers. So instead of playing tactically, people rush right into fights, die early, and then the people left complain about the game being too slow. Then they try to change the game to appeal to people who want it fast, and it ruins it for those who want it slow, and people get alienated from the game. And then you got the esports problem. This game is attracting a lot of attention from esports communities, despite it not being particularly well suited for esports due to lots of RNG elements and the aforementioned technical debt, and the devs start listening to an insular, small, extremely vocal group of minority pro gamers who want the game to become more hardcore. So they change the recoil patterns, make them harder, and then you got these esports players who like it that way, despite it alienating more casual players. That said, these pressures the devs face from the community complicate things, because I feel like they shift pubg away from its roots as a slow tactical game to a more fast paced twitch based shooter, despite it being poorly suited for that from the ground up. PUBG seems to be at a crucial point where it may turn its back on its roots that made it successful to pursue the whims of more vocal elements of the community, who seem to want it to be something different than it actually is. If it were a completely different game say like what islands of nyne is trying to be, it might work. In order to make the game fast paced and twitch heavy, the game needs to be designed around that from the ground up. Movement has to be smooth. Instead it is sluggish. Maps need to be designed for fast paced combat, instead, outside of the newer one, they aren?€?t. The gun mechanics need to be more arcadey, not realistic. Stuff needs to actually load in and render properly at the start of the round, which they often don?€?t because of the massive technical issues that are inherent to the game as it is designed. This game works when it?€?s slow. It works when people play tactically and treat it as a realistic shooter. If they hide, and use cover, and spread out, and try to survive as long as possible. But the second you try to make it fast paced and appeal more to the crowd who wants deathmatch and fast paced esports, the game falls flat on its face. And that?€?s where the game seems to be heading, and in my opinion it may be the downfall of the game.Regardless, before you think that I?€?m gonna rip on pubg and give it a negative review despite all of this complaining, I?€?m not. Because pubg actually looks really good once you start comparing it to the rest of the battle royale genre. The two other major successes in the genre are arcadey, cartoony games with a relatively fantasy setting that just doesn?€?t do it for me. And most games I?€?ve played that go for the more realistic approach just feel soulless at best, or are flat out bad at worst. Honestly, playing these games and coming back to pubg, pubg is like 90% of the way there. It?€?s a great game. It just needs a heck of a lot of polishing and it needs to stop trying to be something it?€?s not to appeal to players who would be better off playing other games."

I find it quite amazing and frankly disturbing how this game can have so much potential and at the same time have so many issues that persist since the first day I bought the game. I have had a tremendous amount of understanding and even defended the game in regards to the persisting issues, however by now its become clear to me that the developers have absolutely no f****** intention of fixing the basic aspects of this game in order to generate a persistingly fun experience. Physics bugs, lag issues and a staggering amount of nonsensical bugs and cheaters in this game simply make the game unplayable and frustrating more than not. So to all future players as much at it pains me to say, go with fortnite (I havent played it but I guarantee its gonna be more fun than this pile of??????????????????.

Right?WRONG! Because if there's one thing that this game taught me is how to turn Hope into sheer, utter disappointment.I wanted to continue loving this game, I wanted to give it another chance, I wanted to put more time into it.But the game never improved, there were a few ""tweaks"" but the game's performance has barely gotten better, the amount of bugs still present can be comparable with one of the crappy Early Access games that can be found all over Steam.However, that didn't stop the developers from putting in more Microtransactions into their game, instead of focusing their time towards improvement.There was none and when there was, it very little.The game is still fun, there is no deying it, but I would never recommend this game to anyone.Not when it's focusing on ruining itself rather than improving itself.I decided to give the game one more shot, to see if I can still get the thrill and emotion from when I first got it, however, It's very unlikely that'll be case.All I can say is, buy it at your own risk, I highly reccommed against it, but ultimately the choice is yours."
578080,1,0,killerkaej,143,1,-1,254.5,"26 July, 2018","I came to PUBG in a weird way. Having bought the game well over a year ago thinking my PC could handle it, I was disappointed to find it couldn't, but hung onto the game to play it on a better PC. That finally happened a couple of weeks ago, and in that time, everything promised has turned to ash.The game is rife with cheats, on all servers, because they are not region locked. The devs have implemented the barest minimum level of checking that all cheaters are easily able to get around. I managed 3rd in one game, presumably out of the cheaters feasting on each other instead of me. The development cycle is a joke with broken netcode STILL after all this time, bugs aplenty, and a sense of futility pervading the whole mess.It could have been so good. When the game was first bandied about online, it looked like the game everyone had been waiting to play in its very early days...and it just stayed there. Two new maps, with one having a disastrous launch.And after all this time, charging full price for the game, they have the bare cheek to put and keep their expensive crate system. Just imagine what this could have been, in the hands of a better developer? Hell, even some of the f2p developers could've turned this into something truly enthralling. There is no chance of that now. PUBG is dead. And a stupid, cartoony, forced 3PP hack job is the only replacement you're getting. Well done Bluehole. You had the golden goose right there in your hands. And you killed it for supper."

Well the official servers are still laggy so start by not expecting much. Custom servers are restricted to streamers or partners of the game, with no future plans to release them to the public. If this was a free to play game, most of these issues would be excusable. But for a price tag, one that is only $10 short of the production quality Overwatch provides, it's not even in the same ballpark. Is it unfair to compare Bluehole to Blizzard? Absolutely. Should Bluehole not charge nearly what Blizzard charges for a ""finished"" game? Absolutely.The fact that I can't sit in a control room and test out guns and attachments in a game that keeps wanting to add more guns and attachments is just dissapointing. I hope the popularity of this game will broadcast the mistakes to other smaller developers on what not to do in this current landscape. In the wake of EA and their money grabbing schemes, people are quick to jump on you for cash grabs. Giving people temporary cosmetics and a $10 pass that isn't worth half the price? Cmon guys. I never put more money in this game after purchase nor will I. If not for lack of quality cosmetic content then for lack of respect of the company."

This game should still be in early access but they rushed it out so they can release lootcrates without breaking their promise that they won't release lootcrates during early access.And now you also have to pay to play on custom servers, because ""they can't provide free servers"". So you're telling me, from the $700 million profit you made last year, you can't put even less than 1% of that into servers for custom game modes so everyone can play those? I call BS. Not to mention the fact this could be solved by letting us host our own servers on our PC or renting one, but instead you force it behind a paywall.The developers are milking as much money they can from this hot garbage before it finally starts to lose players to other (and better) BR games.

578080,2,0,fondestalloy56,242,3,-1,411,"26 July, 2018","The game has no balance to the RNG fest it gives you. When it comes to loot, cover, health. Everything is against you or everything is for you. The skill gap consists of new player, experienced player (just 70% of players), and Shroud. Zone exist to screw you over while you are in a gun fight. Making me wonder if the game wants me to avoid fights because if they take too long or you get into several you will lose track of time and zone then even if you win your fight it doesn't matter there is no reward for doing so, now die. Cover is a issue Fortnite fixed with it's building system which helps a lot because if a player is inbetween you and zone you better bet they are going to sit there until you are force to push them and die because there is really nothing you can do about it. Close range gun fights always feel random as you will never know if you should win them or no because having ""realistic recoil"" mean that the spray is as bad as CSGO but you have to ADS to control it. As well as alway leaving you untouched or a sliver away from death. I LOVE THIS FEEL. It feels like DayZ and Arma combat that is a LOT more smooth, but not smooth enough to not get you kill a LOT. This game is not worth paying the Devs who do not care about it the money and better spend of Devs who are passionate about their work and are not in it just for the money. If you like this style of game just give Fortnite a try I didn't think I would like it but I feel like now there is a real skill gap and reward for being good a that game when I ever felt like I improved in this game every, always I felt either lucky or unlucky, which is only fun in gambling."

But even with the rose tinted glasses that come with being my first, I would be disingenuous to recommend buying this game. This review will not cover any of the controversies such as the lawsuit against EPIC, or the seemingly tone deaf creator who has made statements such as,  ?€?If you?€?re dying to the red zone, then I?€?m sorry but you?€?re not a very good player?€?, but try to take an objective look at what makes PUBG a bad game, and an even worse purchase.One of my main issues with PUBG is the pacing and length of the matches. PUBG matches will often last over forty minutes, assuming you make it to the top ten. While not an issue in and of itself, when paired with the pacing of the match, it leads to an unenjoyable experience that is only exciting during the first and last five minutes. I have spent the majority of my 315+ hours either running or driving to the enclosing circle, only to be killed by someone camping inside a house or behind a tree.This is not a salty rant, but a fact about the game?€?s mechanics itself and how winning caters to those who go out of their way to avoid or vulture fights. There is no benefit to taking on and winning fights, as all gear (with the exception of the air-drop gear) can simply be found in and around the map, which in turn promotes camping. A stark contrast to a game such as Realm Royale that encourages finding and fighting opponents in order to craft the best possible gear. Even the daily missions seem to push a more passive play style with requirements such as, ?€?Survive for 15 minutes in Solos without taking or dealing any damage on Sanhok?€?. The experience is only made more infuriating when you suffer a premature death thanks to one of the many bugs that still riddle PUBG, even after leaving ?€?Early Access?€?. I am not the type to expect a game to have no bugs after its full release, but when you can still be run over by your own car rolling at less than 1 mph after stepping out of it, then there is a problem. Not to mention the horrible server tick rate that can leave you taking damage from behind cover. Summary and Target Price PointPLAYERUNKNOWN?€?S BATTLEGROUNDS is a 4.0 out of 10. It is a game that encourages avoiding your opponents and the majority of your time will be spent running or driving into campers, dying to various bugs and glitches, and taking damage when moving behind cover thanks to horrible server tick rates. Normally priced at $29.99, you can find PLAYERUNKNOWN?€?S BATTLEGROUNDS for less with some patience, if you want to give the game your own verdict.Check out this link to compare price and price history of PLAYERUNKNOWN?€?S BATTLEGROUNDS from your favorite retailers."

I know i am not the only person who has pointed it out. I've heard so many youtubers i watch same the same thing about the poot optimization with this game.-The fact people from other countries can play on north american server and when it comes to playing with them in squads to hard to communicate with them and figure out how to use team work in order to win the game and the fact that communication is a major part to surviving and winning the game. There should be an option in the game that use to use at the main menu where you can choose what type of team mates you want to play with like an english option or another language option.- I have only spent about six hours of playing this game due to the fact every time i die and i view the death cam and see the people who killed me using aimbots or some form of hacks. In a couple of games when I died  again view the death cam and saw a person being miles away and seeing that the person didn't have to aim at me to down then kill me because that person was already  automatically locked on to me even tho i was miles away from that person. The anti-cheat system in place aka battle eye is not doing enough when it comes to the problem of hacks people paid real world money for to use to get an easy kill and an easy win. --The developers seem to have the mindset of making more money off of loot boxes and selling steam keys and event passes instead of listening to use about glitches and bugs that have plagued the game even when it was in early access and they role out updates almost every day but yet the problems that plague the game still are there and not fixed.-At one time this game had 3 million or more players playing this game but a lot of those people l;eft due to all the problems i pointed out in this review. People still play this game it isn't a ghost town but I don't play it cause I am sick of giving the developers creative feedback and they not listening to me nor anyone else The bottom line is this i can't honestly say this game is worth the 30 dollar price tag if anything it should be free to play cause not only are you paying 30 dollars for unfinished product but you also have to play over 2 extra dollars to open a loot box with access to steam keys. I no longer play this game due to all the issues that are plaguing this game it has become borderline unplayable. The state this game is in has become laughable to the point it's not longer funny to me atleast anymore it's more anger that i feel being ripped out of 30 dollars i paid for this game.

But then I realised no one is good at PUBG, well except for Shroud and a few other players. But that's the beauty of it. You play, you die, you play again and that's how you learn. The first few matches, I died instantly. And now, I still die instantly. But atleast I take a few other players with me. I get kills, I emerge happy from the match. In the beginning, I would parachute down and somebody always killed me on my arrival by guns or hands. But now, it's the other way around. I still die to the 3rd or 5th guy I encounter in the match but stil..Well, majority of Earth's population has this game in their library but for those few who doesn't have it, I highly recommend buying this game.

578080,0,0,styrofolme,233,2,-1,14.1,"25 July, 2018","I caved to the hype and bought this game thinking it may be fun to play with friends.  It is the opposite of that.  The matches take way too long to start, so in my 11 hours, I think I may have spent most of it in loading screens and pre-game match area throwing apples at people. because I die about 30 seconds in after touching the ground.  I have watched videos on how to play the game better and I still have only two kills, one I got from shooting an unarmed person who was standing still and one I got from camping in a tiny building staring at the wall for at least 10 minutes straight.  After 11 hours, I realize the game takes time to learn and adjust to, just like any other multiplayer game.  But I figured by this point, I would at least have had fun at one point.  The investment of time spent to learn this game is unreal.  There is no tutorials.  No singleplayer.  No bots.  No other modes than battle royale to get used to the mechanics.  I would not hate this game so much if I had a way to casually learn to play it, either with bots or a casual mode with respawns on a smaller map.  I realize battle royale is the flagship of this game.  And it does improve on open-world mmo combat games in a lot of ways.  I did not expect to go into this game and immediately dominate everyone.  I went in expecting to die. A lot.  What I was not expecting was the wait between deaths.  The process goes as such: Start game.  Select modes.  Quickmatch. Load screen. Waiting area (throw apples at people). Load Screen.  Airplane.  Spam F to jump.  Still get beat to the ground.  Open first door you see.  (Die if you don't find a gun).  Find a gun.  LOAD THE GUN.  Take two steps.  Get shot in the head from an unknown position.  Die. Click back to lobby.  Loading screen.  Click start match.  Rinse. Repeat.  I really do hate this game."

Only problem is I want to love this game more and more everyday, but the devs are literally screwing that up for everyone. Game has been out for over a year and it feels like the only things being added are cosmetic. I have a lot of games in my Steam library and out of all them, PUBG is the only game that will crash my computer entirely. I have put a considerable amount of time into this game with hope that it will get optimized. I hate to say this but I cannot recommend this game. It is amazing, but so beyond flawed. There is so much untapped potential and what saddens me is that the devs just do not care about the community. I will play this until it truly dies, but I simply cannot recommend it.

578080,2,0,7.65612E+16,6,1,1,932.4,"25 July, 2018","The Good: This is one of the most interesting shooters I have played in the last 10 years. It combines the FPS experience, fire team tactical based action with a survival/battle royale experience. The maps are enjoyable, the War Mode is a nice change of pace and they are always adding new content. What I like most about this game is that there is no pay to win element at all. In the end you decide if you are going to run and gun, ambush or sneak away and avoid contact with enemy players. The longer the game goes the more the tension builds and the feeling of a win is probably the best feeling of any game I have played in my entire gaming career (20+ years). The game also doesn't have the childish feel of some of its competitors. Its graphics are good (even on low which is used to increase frame rate) and the game feels realistic without being annoyingly realistic. The Bad: The problem with this game is that it consistently has bugs and connection issues not to mention cheaters. Blue Hole needs to: 1) Resolve the connection issues, clean up bugs and continue to work on eliminating cheaters. *24/9/18 Despite the crying twitch streamers the connection issues have improved althought desync is still a problem. They have also added a nice feature to tell you when your report has resulted in a ban on a player that cheated""2) Advise the player base when server maintenance will occur in game and ahead of time. *24/9/18 - This is being done at least same day*3) Remove the red zone, it is useless and only causes frame rate drops. 4) Create a shooting range/practice area. Allow new players to get better with the weapons and existing players to try new guns. *24/9/18 This has been added and is excellent*5) Have the final zones be centered for all players to mitigate at least some of the RNG. 6) Allow players to select what map they want to play. *24/9/18 Partially fixed, you can choose between the new and the old maps at least*7) Have more events but reduce the cost and make all content won permanent. *24/9/18 More events have been added with no cost other than time in game. Very nice*9) Add weather to all maps. Rain and fog on Erangel and a sandstorm on Miramar. *24/9/18 This has been added to great effect.*I would add two new ones as of 24/9/1810) Slightly increase loot on Erangel. I shouldn't be dropping with my squad in hot locations, winning that location and coming out with one partially upgraded gun.11) Vary the final zones a bit more. On Sanhok the zone is consistently ending in the same predictable place."

But there never was a chance of seeing something like that at the time.Time passes, things change. And so did gaming industry. With all the money and technology coming into the industry it quickly became a place for passion and fun, that some people like me enjoyed for some time.But time still passes and things still change. You start to see less titles with proper design and solutions and more moneygrab half?????????????????????raw products with no dedication to the final product.Then crowdfunding comes in. We get promises, devs get final user expectations to meet(or do they now?). Plus making a game is no longer that much risky if you get your money first and then stretch time frames to the ones you are comfortable with. And you also have a wall to hide behind if someone is getting impatient. Because early access right? Sadly, yeah.Then come the consoles, with which you need to cut production costs by all means to gain profit. Console hardware becomes less competitive, so what do you do? Develop for the consoles first, and then port, usually making pc experience somewhat hindered.Money took over the industry. The most of it. Its not that bad, but i really miss the times, where i bought a game and could expect full scaled single player, proper settings(hard fps locks on pc? please!), fresh titles, new experience and so on.Then with industry rising come popularity. People make games a meaningful part of its society, so now its on the devs to make games appeal to buyers, investors, managers, so they would sell more. Its just not about passion or fun anymore. Not about perfection or stuff that makes sense.Greed corrupts. Not really an eye-opener i know, but i miss skill ceilings of classic CS or UT or quake. I miss believable sandboxes i spent days in. I miss myself enjoying all the little details games threw at me. Not much of that going on now.Same with this game. Get money, then get even more. Throw the words at you so you stay for a bit longer. Spend some more, having expectations. So far it works, wonder if it ever won't.I like how competitive shooters always want balance included. And it usually works by just oversaturating the game with guns or some ?????????????????????t nerfs or other lame design choices that smell of laziness.But you will always have some loot crates, be sure of that.I just wonder how bad can products get in the future with trends like that.Still waiting for bullet penetration? Proper anticheat? Target practice? FPP servers in your vicinity? Ranking system? Actually dynamic vaulting? Hitreg optimizations? More FPS? After 1.0? U mad???"

They keep updating it with things nobody wants or asked for and they keep digging themselves into a deeper and deeper hole. The game runs decently well but nothing incredible but it feels very unresponsive and like its missing something. I am very dissapointed to see a crate/key system come to this game, with a $30 price tag that shouldnt be an option. Im all for skins and customization but there are more user freindly ways to do that than RNG lootboxes and $2.50 required keys. Its sad to see such a great game turn to this. The game had lots of potential and the PUBG corp killed it. I am sad to say I no longer play this game and I cant see myself going back to it."
578080,1,0,MLGSOUP,30,6,-1,816.9,"25 July, 2018","This game resembles a man born healthy and then had a stroke mid way through life.  PUBG was a great game when I started playing it shortly after it came out. It was an amazing game and i spent hundreds of hours playing. Mid way through the game's life is when the stroke happened. I don't know if they just decided they didn't care about the game anymore or what, but they ruined the game in my opinion. It is extremely unfun to play the game I used to look forward to playing every day. Movements feel clunky, frames are not good for the graphics, the servers are laggy, the gunplay is very unsatisifying, and it all around was simply much better before they tried to change things hastefully. For many, many months, you could not even choose if you wanted to play on the original  forest map or the new desert map. This game was extremely promising but it killed itself. They also showed how low the PUBG Corporation is when they sued Fortnite, they simply were jelous that Fortnite was doing so much better then they were while being free and a completely different game. Overall, I would strongly recomend NOT getting this game in it's current state. Maybe in the future they can restore this game to its formal glory but I believe the damage was done and it might be too late to save this game with such great potential."

Here is a message to the cheaters: What's the point? You're supposed to practice to get good at a game. I'm not very good at this game but I practice and I will continue and I'll get better. With di**heads like you around you ruin the game, the community and the fun for everyone (even yourself). F**k you if you cheat and I hope you get permabanned from all games on all platforms for the rest of your life, you piece of s**t! Get better or just f*k off and leave the rest of us to play fairly.I'm sorry to the developers to give this a thumbs down because of cheaters. However, I don't feel so bad considering how much of a rip-off the stupid micro-transactions are, especially needing a key (??2.50) to unlock certain crates. So therfore that alone deserves a thumbs down.If all this was resolved then I would definitely recommend this game. Until then wait for a sale and keep checking on reviews to see when the cheaters have all been removed."

What you get in those cases - generic uninspired items which you can sell on community market for like 3 cents. Also shouldn't forget to mention that the best items have drop rate like 0.001 %. So this is what this game has become. Adding to it poor performance, little to non meaningful updates, new battle pass extrem fail (non-tradeable items, most beautiful items expired within battle pass perrod), perf. problems with new map when there are many players in a little area (devs promised to fix the issue) and list goes on and on... But it's alright guys, at least we've got e-sports right! Developers became greedy and lazy, potential I've seen in this game when it first came to steam is long time gone.

578080,0,0,Hyalgamer,205,9,-1,80.6,"25 July, 2018","I've followed this game since beta, and also played the mod and such relevant to its creation. And the game itself, its gameplay is alright, gradually becoming more varied, however there is an issue when it comes to cost.The game itself is ??26.99(GBP) That in itself isn't too expensive however, you then discover how littered this game has become with micro-transactions. Which I was hoping it wouldn't be. Perhaps it is the influx of Twitch Streamers, perhaps its the fact that this game has become a contender for the Esports scene. I don't know.When I used to play this before, you got BattlePoints or BP to spend on a crate, you then opened it for free, and got some cosmetics. That was fine.Now, I shall give you a list of the microtransactions I have seen, ONLY FROM THE STORE. Whether there is any others available I don't know, this is PURELY from the STORE section, in game.ALL PRICES ARE IN GBP.A collection of Cosmetic Hoodies, and Weapon skins.??7.62 Each. EACH.Keys to open 5 of the 10 available crates.??1.91 EACH.Now, the in-game system for crates is an amount of BattlePoints that scales up per crate you buy (resets every week still, as far as I'm aware.) Starting at 700 BP. You'll notice it says ""A RANDOM CRATE"" underneath. This is not a lie, if you preview the random crate, it shows 10 Crates and their potenital items. 5 of which have keys for in the store. Which means presumably the other 5 are free to unlock. Pretty generous you might say, but that boils down to each time you open a random crate, you have a 50% Chance to get a crate that requires a key. Fabulous.The gameplay itself is alright, I'll often find myself wanting a more diverse system but then you could argue that it does what it was intended to well, be a Battle Royale game. The mechanics are fairly polished now, much more so than when I last played and the core gameplay is alright, nothing spectacular. So in review of my review,If you want a game that is a decent Battle Royale game, is semi-realistic in it's graphics and gameplay, this is probably the better Battle Royale game on the market. However, it is laden with Micro-transactions. So if you have a tendency to buy them, you might want to keep your aching wallet which has just had ??26.99 GBP Deducted from it for the games purchase far away from reach. I wouldn't mind if it was F2P. Yet it is not. And it's not even that cheap.""Decent game. However a micro-transaction laden hell hole."""

This game gave me feelings and excitement in games that I've never yet experienced before in any other game! The rush of adrenalin when you get top 10 (especially your first few times) is just awesome!Although I play it most days still, it's infuriating and has become just a money grab right now. Devs constant promises of fixing the servers and desync etc (or just completely ignoring it) has become too much for many. This game had such promise and to be honest, still does if the devs work on the core issues rather than releasing new cosmetics and crates (that you need  to pay for a key to open the crates in most cases!!). In summary - Yes I've had some of my best gaming moments ever playing this game, it is truly special experience. The game is well optimized in terms of FPS and smoothness compared to last year when it got a lot of (deserved) hate. But I cannot whole heatedly recommend it unless you have money to throw away. Not to mention the desync and server issues (dying behind a wall because your opponents still see you peeking etc.) Here's to hoping the devs can transform the game and restore it to it's former glory, as there will never be another BR quite like this one.TLDR; Buy it if you want a crazy adrenalin rush and have money to throw away, but otherwise it's not worth the money in it's current state."

Cant remember the last time I played FPP solo on OC and alot of other modes too on OC just go to a asia server now. (sorry cant stand TPP)Played from Early access and was better then.

No stuttering and the game loads in fine with an SSD. A few months ago I would not have been able to say the same thing as there used to be a horrid FPS, the game would not load textures in properly and it would just be a bad experience in general.Cheaters? I have seen some cheaters, but really it's not as bad as people make it out to be. About 1 in 30 matches I encounter a cheater (if I made it into the top 5 more often that number may have been different)The new map was also an amazing addition to the game and, for me at least, increased my game's performance a lot. Loot crates are in the game and they are not at all worth opening, but I have made some quick money by selling the crates themselves on the community market.Overall, it's a great game in its best state ever since launch (in my opinion). Worth buying now or getting back into it if you quit because of the many issues the game used to suffer from."

That being said, PUBG is NOT worth $30.Personally, I've had really good games and then I've had extremely ???????????????????????? games where Asian hackers or graphics completely ruin the game. The ?????????????????? thing is that if you play on the lowest graphics setting, grass won't render that far, meaning that if someone--let's say, 100m-200m out--is laying in grass, you won't see the grass, but you'll see the person. Not only that, but I hate that no matter what, I'll be spending half the game looting or running across the map and die just like that.Not only that, but playing most of the maps, you'll find yourself in the middle of butt???????????? nowhere. I mean, literally half of the map is just empty space...not so realistic imho. The ?????????????????? thing is that the developers don't really focus on optimizing the current maps, they only care about pushing out new content, which in turn, is??????????????????(except the 4x4 map...that's an ok map).The really ????????????ed up thing is that I keep getting sucked into this game because 1. I don't really care for building??????????????????in ????????????ing Fornite, and 2.

On Miramar, you can expect little to no concealment, very little cover besides buildings and rocks (which is a personal complaint tbh.) However something that is bad and has affected both my friends and I, has been the invisible rocks and rises in the ground of what appears to be an inch that stops vehicles in their paths. Not only does this damage the vehicles if you're going at a high enough speed (always), it also damages your character.   Next up, were the hackers and cheaters. Early on, it's understandable for a ""new"" MMO game to have its shares of hackers who can shoot through walls, hills, and across the maps. Most of these hackers obviously came from a certain country located on the continent of Asia. However, despite questions into whether region lock could be added to deter normal folks who bought for a fun gameplay experience to not have to deal with hackers, they were told it was racist to even speak of such an idea. So now, forgetful Asians, as well as their in-game ad bots are populating the North American server as that was set as the default server.  Now, on to loot crates, season passes, and the new map. PUBGCorps has decided to go down the path of another somewhat successful videogame studio in terms of how many microtransactions it can add to a single game. So, you now have to buy keys with actual money, rather than just the in-game currency which you buy crates with. You can see the confusion. To add to this, with the release of a pretty decent map known as Sanhok they also brought in the Event Pass. Now, you're able to complete missions and are rewarded with free loot! Unless, it's ""special event"" loot which times out after 30 days in which case you will lose it forever. But you get lots of free loot! Unless, it's Event Pass only loot. Then you have to buy an event pass to get it while also completing missions. But you get free loot!  With their most recent ""maintenance"" and updates, de-sync is more powerful than ever. If you have bad internet connection or speed, you will rubberband. Sounds fun right?2/10. This game is garbage now, but it gave me and my friends some good laughs and good rounds."

Despite all the tweens raging about the same things over and over:              ""OPTIMIZE SERVERZ, MAP SELECT, FIX BUG"" this game is actually HELLA fun!   Every match is thrilling, every kill incredibly satisfying, and when you actually win a game, you will feel a wave of emotion throughout your entire body.    How many games offer that? If you ever played and enjoyed a first person shooter, then you will love this game. If you have ever wanted to try a Battle Royale game, look no further.  As for the negative reviews:  90% of them are trolls/teens.  Here are their most common complaints:BUGS/CRASHING: My game crashed TWICE in the 300 hours I played.MAP SELECT: If you don't like the desert map, you can literally back out of the match with zero penalty and join another match.No clue why they keep whining about NET CODE: I get the lowest pings I've ever gotten in any game I've ever played with PUBG.  HACKERS:  The ONLY legitimate complaint.  Yes, there are hackers, just like in every FPS ever made.  Do hackers ruin the entire game?  Short answer, No.  Is it annoying to be killed by a hacker?  Short answer, Extremely.Is Bluehole addressing this issue as one of their primary objectives?  YEP.I give this game a 95/100.  They kept the game true to itself throughout all the updates, including the 2 new maps.  And you only pay once to play this game.  There is literally nothing else you need to buy."

While I'm growing bored of the Battle Royale genre, there's no denying its replayability. PUBG was the first game to really capitalise on this recently and it's as successful as it is for a reason. That being said, the game has some performance issues so you need a pretty beefy rig to play it, but I wouldn't call that a reason to dislike the game. The only real problem I have with it is the price and the number of microtransactions. Since you get can a similar experience for free from Fortnite, the current selling price is this game in my opinion. Also, the game has a similar microtransaction system to Fortnite, which is just annoying. Fortnite is a free game and needs to make it's money, while PUBG costs ??27 quid. My suggestion to the devs is to take the same F2P model as Fortnite or scrap the microtransactions. Still, if you have the money and a few friends, I'd definitely recommend giving it a go."

578080,0,0,RoxofoxeR,1,7,-1,55.3,"20 October, 2018","25 hours into the game.  This is what I know so far.First off, there are TONS AND TONS AND TONS AND TONS AND TONS of cheaters.  Yes, you can report them, and yes, the developer takes the reports seriously.  It won't do much good, as there are so many cheating these days that it'll not even start to make a dent to report every cheater you get.Second, this game is an exercise in how to not have fun.  The learning curve is ENORMOUS.  You're just now starting out, and for those few people not cheating they've been playing long enough that they're superhuman.  VERY few people will give you any information or help.Third, the problem with Chinese people getting into US servers is still a very big thing.  Mroe than 70% of my teammates are still Chinese even after the patch that ""fixed"" that problem.  Of course, they almost never have a mic or speak english, so if they do have a mic they don't speak at all. The ones that do speak so little english that they may as well not speak.Fourth, this game will cause you to lose because of the desync a LOT, and by a LOT I mean almost every map you are going to lose because of desync, or because the other guy is cheating like crazy, or because weird glitches happen like ""a floating bush appears in front of you, so if you touch it you explode"".The game is so seriously flawed it's not really playable.  You will not win a chicken dinner unless you've already played for a very, very long time or you're cheating like crazy.  It's just not possible.  But, it can still be fun if you recognize that fact and play anyways, right?Not usually.  You'll die by the cheapest stuff ever imagined, like ""you nose dive immediately when the plane allows you to jump out, so you should land absolutely first. When you get towards the ground, three dozen people pass you.  They get guns immediately and shoot you as soon as you drop your chute"".  Or, ""you land as fast as possible.  As you move towards the building only two feet from you, a guy that somehow already landed and found a vehicle runs you over as his buddy who already landed and found a gun that is hitching a ride shoots you"".The game is just unplayable.  I can't get my 30 bucks back from steam because I've had it for a week, but you can't tell that it's an unplayable, broken game within the time frame they give you for refunds - it takes longer than that to install.  So instead, I'll be doing a bank fee reversal for the cost of this game, and if steam bans my account for doing so I really don't care because they allowed a game as broken as this to be on the store for this long without forcing the developer to fix the game or pull it from the site until it is fixed.  I don't care.  This was MY money for a working game that can be possible to enjoy, not broken crap that you can't possibly enjoy due to cheaters, server problems, and maps seeming to think it's fun to never give people weapons (land in named areas to find weapons my???????????????).Oh, and the ""we're sorry for the problems, here's free RP"" was a slap in the face.  All the stuff you can buy with the RP requires a key to unlock, and keys of course cost real money.I'm having my bank reverse charges."

It's incredibly frustrating to survive for 15-20 minutes only to die in your first confrontation with another player because it's too laggy and confused to aim. Can't recommend until it will run smoothly on even a high end machine. Are there things I can do to my machine to improve it? Yes, I can, and am, playing at the lowest quality setting. Why really should it be up to me to tweak my machine to run your game right?"

The closest I can get the game to a playable state is by using colourblind mode, but i'm pretty sure that counts as cultural appropriation so for me it's best to just uninstall the game. I never want to see a shade of blue so ugly ever again - I wasn't even sure that was possible, this design choice must have been deliberate - BlueHole might have some kind of master plan to mind control people with this new colour. I'd recommend staying away from buying or playing this game until they return the colour of the blue zone back to it's original state."

If this lawsuit would've gone through it could've set a bad precedent for all games, where it could've become a fight for who 'was first' (even though the earliest instance of a 'Battle Royale' theme is likely the movie, 'Battle Royale') and sueing the rest. Besides, how downright unintelligent do you have to be to sue other developers for the use of a FRYING PAN as a weapon in a game. Yeah, PUBG definetely came up with that concept, if you ignore Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead and even the movie 'Battle Royale'.Do NOT buy PUBG on Steam or anywhere else. Don't download it on your phone. Just don't.

Some cons though, are the vehicle systems (unstable death traps), server lag/de-sync issues, and the absense of a shooting range in which players can test/practice the many weapons in game. Another thing that grinds my gears is the Red Zone, a BR game should not do random damage like this. Also the loot tables. there have been times where I have been in 4 different houses and I have yet to find a gun. If you are new to PC games I would not recommend. If you have a background in other shooters, then I would definitely recommend. There are several minor issues which, if fixed, could easily compete with it's competitors. I feel that PUBG corp. is slowly making the game better, focusing on the bigger issues, such as cheaters, optimization and bug fixes. Though I feel like minor issues such as server lag/de-sync, bad vehicle system, etc. should be rolled out before new content such as new guns, maps, etc."

Unfortunatly the only thing that has progressed in this game is the amount of hackers present. These no-recoil hacks have gotten way out of control and the develper is complaicent with trying to fix the issues.

578080,2,0,Forgefist,611,7,-1,198.5,"23 July, 2018","I played the Beta of PUBG, and have played a few rounds each session, maybe 3-4 times a week ever since picking it up shortly after it came out. I am by no means a dedicated player, and nor do I have the intention of being, so this is purely from the experience and viewpoint of a ""casual"" player, someone who mostly plays for fun with friends, but has at least experienced a decent number of chicken dinners.I want to be able to give a positive recommendation for the game, I truly do, but as it stands I am worried that some of the design decisions for the game are taking it away from the niche which is what initially brought people in to begin with, and instead making more and more decisions that seem to bring it more in line with a deathmatch FPS. Maybe this is what people want, I don't know, but I got into this game for the Battle Royale experience, the tactical decision making that can bring you either glorious victory or horrible defeat, if I wanted a pure deathmatch, run at the opponents and die over and over, I'd play CoD or Battlefield, or whatever it is the kids play these days, but I don't.Making smaller maps and trying to focus gameplay into a few minutes of action in ""hotspots"" just makes the rest of the game become more and more stale, I understand why this is happening, they look to youtube and streamers, who cater to an action needing audience, and this influences the game in the wrong direction. You only have to look at the now-reverted changes they made to quicken the bluezone as an indication that this isn't what the playerbase want. People want to drop in a place, gear up, whether they want to fight for it or not, and then out-think their opponents, out position, out gun, and ultimately out perform them to pick up a win. That is what feels good, and they should take this into consideration rather than trying to force a faster pace of the game.While we're at it, let's discuss the maps. Initially, the original map was my favourite... when Miramar came out, I disliked it, I thought, it's too easy to spot people, the guns are worse, etc etc, but as time went on, my viewpoint did a 180, and Miramar became by far my favourite, the hills never fail to allow for decent positioning if you care to go for those spots, and there are always a smattering of buildings available regardless of where you land, whereas it feels like in Erangel... there are huge stretches of open field which are basically like a no-mans land, run across them at your peril. I would love to see Erangel revamped with their newer map design in mind, but we'll see. We still have a ways to go before that's considered, I'm betting. I won't even bother with Sanhok, because as stated... I just don't like the idea of the smaller map. A personal preference probably.So yeah, while I would like to give a positive recommendation, I can't. I am genuinely concerned with the state of the game, and while I do still play it, I'm not entirely sure I could in good conscience advise people to buy it when the future of the game is uncertain to me. There are other battle royale games coming into their own now, and I fear that rather than focus on bringing PUBG into a better place, Bluehole are just gonna keep pushing the game into the wrong direction.Oh, and if you do buy the game. Never, and I do mean NEVER, get into a trike unless you are prepared for the game to flip you in every direction it can before instant killing you. I don't know what the hell they did to the physics engine to cause these things to happen, but the bike with the sidecar is a deathtrap that has ended many a run."

We never would have ended up with this kind of business model if we hadn't proved that we would willingly spend real money for a chance to get a digital item. PUBG used this as a foundation and took it to an extreme. $2.50 PER KEY to unlock ONE CRATE for a very, VERY small drop chance (less than 0.1% for the rarest items), with SPECIFIC KEYS for SPECIFIC CRATES. The game is a buggy, laggy mess that has turned cheating into a legitimate business model that makes money for both the cheater AND Bluehole. But Bluehole hasn't dealt with those issues because they don't need to. They don't even need to SAY they will. We all just assume that the devs will fix the problem, and so we keep playing. And keep spending. So go ahead. Throw them another $30, plus a key or two, and maybe the new $10 season pass (which is a direct copy of Fortnite). You'll enjoy PUBG for a little while, I suppose. Then you'll uninstall it, post a ""Do Not Recommend"" review, maybe cry about it on social media or on YouTube, and no one will care. Just know that your money is going directly into a lawsuit against Epic Games. Not into improving the code, or tightening the security, or stablizing the framerate. They don't care about that. It's going into attacking the competition.Just know that this is our fault. YOUR fault, if you buy it.

578080,2,0,GumballWatterson,168,6,-1,144.5,"23 July, 2018","It seems to be buying a game in the genre of"" battle Royale"", and got some horror, with elements of science fiction. You can go to the thing and try to take it, but it will just stay in place or just disappear. And maybe youll have it in 5 seconds. It is possible that in this game items have their own mind.Your opponents can sometimes move leaps and bounds. I dont know if its due to the Chrono-shift or if the enemies cant sync up in our reality, but its going to be hard to damage them. With you incidentally this, too, can will happen.Transport in the game also has its own mind. If you Park next to any object (fence, barrel, wall, etc.) then the car will not like it and it will start to rage, attack the offender or just roar. Also game have anomaly ""Springboard"" like in  S.T.A.L.K.E.R and if during the trip you missed it, you can fly up a few meters even if you were driving on a flat road. Do not believe that all people in the game. In fact, there are creatures from the other world, which only represent the model of human behavior. But when theyre in danger, they use their powers. Here is an incomplete list: immortality, self-guided bullets, vision through the walls, teleporting to any point at the request of the owner, the transformation of any land transport in the flying, fast movement (Sonic mode). Also, these creatures, though deprived of reason, but has a sense of purpose, evolution and rapid reproduction that even developers can not cope with them. What would you not think that you can easily win just by developing strategies for survival and knowing the subtleties, the game pumps you a special poison. This poison can distort your perception of the world due to what will seem that the picture slows down or there is an effect of framing, leads one to suspect the Bush gave the enemy, makes you think you're safe lying in the grass, however, actually lie in an empty field. Also, this poison is able to give you a false trajectory for grenades and you throw it out the window and into the wall, false hope of causing damage to the enemy, although you do not get on it or just do not shoot (hallucination), periodically you will have the feeling that the game is physics.Like a cherry on a cake, the game has its own screamer. His name is ""Bad Module"" and he can arise at any time (he does not mean himself a quiet frightening music). Although it is difficult to call it a screamer, since for the most part it makes you angry.The game has some more ""strange"" things, but I wrote about the ones I encounter more often."

578080,2,0,krunalchandra,23,2,-1,119.5,"23 July, 2018","I struggle to understand why custom games are hosted on a PUBG server with a ten player starting requirement. Its dumb. In games such as CSGO, when I want to host a private game with friends, the server runs off my computer and friends can join the server that is created. It's a simple peer to peer system. Now I do appreciate that PUBG is more intensive for a sever to run, but at least make hosting your own server and option for those who can run it. Also, the 10 player requirrment is silly, it should only be 2 players to begin. In my honest opinion, custom games are great however the devs have once more managed to turn something that should be awsome into something that we all have to complain about because of uncalled for restrictions and stupid limitations to something that, had the models of other games been acknowledged, could have been excellent."

First let's talk about glitches, for a game that's been out almost 2 years, it's extremely buggy, the sheer buggyness alone should keep you far far away from this game. Then there are crates. You unlock crates with in game currency but most of the time the random crate you get has to be unlocked with a key only obtainable by a $2 key you have to use real money for. then when you do open the crate it's the same fricking shirt you got the last 30 times you opened a crate.And finally, hackers.

The only reason i'm not recommending it is because i think at the current price ($29.99), its not worth it. I bought on sale ($19.99) and didn't regret the purchase.IMO I enjoy the mobile version of PUBG way more because the details and features it has make the game way more enjoyable then the PC version. (I'm not great at either game but i can tell when more effort is put somewhere)Mobile PUBG pros/cons vs PC PUBG pros/con-the loot system is is much generous with crates, clothes, skins, points etc. (more F2P friendly)-missions/rewards system actually give you something to look forward to, while PC pubg doesnt have this incorporated-the options of auto-pickup/reload, weapon modes, peek modes, auto-chosing best health to use and being able to disable/enable all these features is a HUGE plus. (if you've ever played mobile to for awhile and then go play PC, you'll see what i mean)-having an actual chat where you can type (even its on a small phone is a nice feature)-being able to choose which map to play on & auto-matching not required (even though its between 2 maps currently)-arcade mode (gives you 3modes to play other then just playing the regular game) [I know PUBG released custom matchs open beta but they are actually looking at CHARGING people $$$ for that in the future :|]-Training grounds... totally forgot about this great feature.

On the one hand, it started the battle royale phenomenon and is really fun to play a lot of the time. On the other hand, it's painfully obvious that the developers place their paying customers as a low priority, there are a few ideas that support this.1.) They do nothing about region problem. If you are a North American player, the odds of you getting a squad that speaks your same native language are very slim. This makes communication impossible, and the others you play against lag. There have been weekends in which after queuing for 12 games in a row, not one time was there another English speaking player in my squad, and about a quarter of these rounds were lost to an obvious cheater.It is also primarily Chinese players who are a problem when it comes to spamming servers with their advertisements for cheating software in game and then leave your squad. This is solved with a region lock, something Bluehole refuses to do and has even made it seem like players are racist or malicious for noticing this.2.) Bluehole makes sure to prioritize things like unlockable, pay-for items like crates before addressing game-breaking bugs. You can still get stuck in a large variety of places in the map in which you can not move or get out, rendering the game over for you if you enter the wrong building or part of the map.The main reason I would not recommend this game anymore is because I feel like it supports bad change in the world to continue financially supporting companies like Bluehole. Their actions speak loudly as to what their priorities are, and it isn't the person who paid full price for a game title."

I seriously hope PUBG either starts giving us a really rich an varied game or just fades and dies and lets another more deserving company provide my entertainment.

I ready believe the persons responsible for this game do not play it and have no idea how many frustanting things there are in the game. I will revisit my review when they actually do something good to improve the game.Right now I enjoy more watching the game (mainly just tournaments since even watching normal streaming is now boring since they have nothing to play for).

However, living in Australia and trying to get a game on the OCE servers is driving everyone down here absolutely mental. If I could, I would constantly be playing FPP solo in OCE unless my squad members are on. However, if we are playing solo, we are forced to try get into a Squad-FPP as a solo because of the ""estimated wait times"" being broken. If the wait time says anything over 1 minute, it's not worth trying because the server is busted. If only they could fix the servers, their player base in OC queues would return to normal, but when it is consistently broken we are forced out of the game. I decided I would not recommend this game to anyone based on the server performance, even though it is one of the best games I have ever played. I don't mind the de-sync and little bugs that occassionally appear, but when youo can't even get a game on your countries server, the game developers need to be held accountable and we need to hear more frequent responses about their plans to fix the issue.Rant over."

I've been playing FPS games since the Goldeneye era (N64) and everything in between since. I think my opinion is worth SOMETHING, so I'll tell you what I think about the game. If you dont want to read the review, go to the TL;DR section.**My PC Setup**Ryzen 1700 @ 3.8GTX 1060 6GB OCed16gb Ram @ 2933144hz Asus Monitor 148 GB SSD1TB WD HDDetc etc;For starters, getting into a game takes forever. It's the main reason I dont hot drop. I hate sitting in the lobby for 30 secs/min just to get into the plane. Not to mention, even when I do hotdrop and land next to somebody, they somehow ALWAYS find a gun while I'm still trying to pick up a weapon but cant, cause the servers suck. Anyone else land next to somebody and your sitting there right clicking on a weapon but you're just not picking it up? WTF is that ?????????????????????t?Aside from that, Erangel (the better of the two maps IMO) doesnt get rotated enough between Miramar (map sucks). They USE to have a feature where you could select between the two maps and I for one would always choose Erangel, Miramar NEVER got played by me, when I had the option to select what map I wanted to play on. Now, with the latest patch, they FORCE you into playing that crap map. Wtf Blueballs?! First you take away our rain,fog etc; Now this? I should have the option to play whatever map I want to play. Sanhok breathed some life into the game for me when it released as I felt that Erangel/Miramar just wasnt my playstyle. I prefer fast paced shooters and not running simulators. Even w/Sanhok out, I can really only stomach about 2/3 games before I rage and play Paladins. The Dsync is terrible, hackers are still rampant(albeit, not as bad pre 1.0), physics still suck and not to mention, I have 12 crates I cant open because they're locked behind a ????????????ing paywall. As it stands, I'm currently downloading IoN and if that game plays better than this mess, I'll uninstall this game and possibly never play it. The game has potential for sure but I truly doubt the devs even notice it. They're too busy lining their pockets w/ $$ instead of fixing their broken???????????????game. The only time I have fun is when I'm playing w/friends. Playing this game solo is boring as?????????????????? Oh, I almost forgot. Playing for BP in this game is a joke. Cause when you have enough to get a crate, you know what you get? Copies of??????????????????you already have or a crate that needs a key to be unlocked. ???????????? that ?????????????????????t.

Hitreg is a mess, servers lag, controls are sluggish and framerates are inconsistent and will plummet at any second. The devs don't seem to care about actually fixing the game and instead pump more and more maps, cosmetics and other useless??????????????????into the pile (granted, the new map makes for faster, better games)They even decided it would be a good idea to run another tournament to try keep the game alive. (which is advertised excessively in-game)and the event/battle pass? oh nooh no.DON'T TRY SUE EPIC GAMES FOR COPYING YOUR IDEAS THEN BLATANTLY STEAL THEIRS YA DUMB ????????????S(remember they own the engine you scraped this??????????????????together with)tl;drFIX THE ????????????ING GAME FIRST SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO PLAY IT, THEN ADD CONTENT!"

578080,0,0,b3nderbot,46,4,-1,348.6,"21 July, 2018","I only have about 329 hours of playtime, so take my review w/a grain of salt. I've been playing FPS games since the Goldeneye era (N64) and everything in between since. I think my opinion is worth SOMETHING, so I'll tell you what I think about the game. If you dont want to read the review, go to the TL;DR section.**My PC Setup**Ryzen 1700 @ 3.8GTX 1060 6GB OCed16gb Ram @ 2933144hz Asus Monitor 148 GB SSD1TB WD HDDetc etc;For starters, getting into a game takes forever. It's the main reason I dont hot drop. I hate sitting in the lobby for 30 secs/min just to get into the plane. Not to mention, even when I do hotdrop and land next to somebody, they somehow ALWAYS find a gun while I'm still trying to pick up a weapon but cant, cause the servers suck. Anyone else land next to somebody and your sitting there right clicking on a weapon but you're just not picking it up? WTF is that ?????????????????????t?Aside from that, Erangel (the better of the two maps IMO) doesnt get rotated enough between Miramar (map sucks). They USE to have a feature where you could select between the two maps and I for one would always choose Erangel, Miramar NEVER got played by me, when I had the option to select what map I wanted to play on. Now, with the latest patch, they FORCE you into playing that crap map. Wtf Blueballs?! First you take away our rain,fog etc; Now this? I should have the option to play whatever map I want to play. Sanhok breathed some life into the game for me when it released as I felt that Erangel/Miramar just wasnt my playstyle. I prefer fast paced shooters and not running simulators. Even w/Sanhok out, I can really only stomach about 2/3 games before I rage and play Paladins. The Dsync is terrible, hackers are still rampant(albeit, not as bad pre 1.0), physics still suck and not to mention, I have 12 crates I cant open because they're locked behind a ????????????ing paywall. As it stands, I'm currently downloading IoN and if that game plays better than this mess, I'll uninstall this game and possibly never play it. The game has potential for sure but I truly doubt the devs even notice it. They're too busy lining their pockets w/ $$ instead of fixing their broken???????????????game. The only time I have fun is when I'm playing w/friends. Playing this game solo is boring as?????????????????? Oh, I almost forgot. Playing for BP in this game is a joke. Cause when you have enough to get a crate, you know what you get? Copies of??????????????????you already have or a crate that needs a key to be unlocked. ???????????? that ?????????????????????t. TL;DRPros:Good weapon mechanicsFairly RealisticCars you can DriveVOIPCons:DsyncUn-Optimized GraphicsFPS Drops galore when dropping in popular cities/townsKillcams suckLeveling system is garbageLoot cratesBrandon GreeneNo Region lockNOT E-Sport readyWould NOT recommend this game in it's current state."
